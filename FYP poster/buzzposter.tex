     %Brief Introduction explaining broader significance of research problem and the gap in knowledge that is being addressed
     %%% Bee-flower interactions differ drastically between subsequent seasons or even weeks. However, this high interaction turnover has been largely overlooked by previous studies, which assume a static picture of pollination networks. Understanding how and why bee-flower interactions vary over time is crucial in the conservation of bees, and in the continuation of their pollination services. Moreover, climate change can result in fluctuating flowering times, thereafter indirectly sabotaging bee-flower interactions. \\
     Understanding how and why plant-pollinator networks (e.g., bee-flower) interactions vary over time is crucial in the conservation of pollinators, and in the continuation of their pollination services. Moreover, climate change can result in fluctuating flowering times, therefore affecting or driving turnover in plant-pollinator interactions. The structure of bee-flower interaction networks are likely to differ between seasons or even shorter timescales of weeks to months. However, this interaction turnover has been largely been ignored by previous research on plant-pollinator networks, which assume a static picture of pollination networks. \\

Whittaker's dissimilarity index, $\boldsymbol{ \beta_{int}}$, reflects the difference between two successive monthly networks.

    \begin{align*}
      \boldsymbol{ \beta_{int}} & = \frac{a + b + c}{(2a + b + c)/2} - 1
    \end{align*}\\

    \vspace{0pt}
    where:    
    \begin{itemize}
     \item $a$ is the number of interactions shared between the two networks  
    \item $b$ and $c$ are the number of unique interactions in the two networks
    \end{itemize}
 \vspace{20pt}
 $\boldsymbol{ \beta_{int}}$ ranges from 0 to 1. \\
 A higher $\boldsymbol{ \beta_{int}}$ reflects a higher difference between monthly networks.

    \item Monthly bee-flower interaction turnover is higher than ever reported before. Mean turnover rate is 
    \item There are no significant differences between turnover rates within seasons and between seasons.
    \item There is a periodic pattern in turnover of bee-flower interactions.
    \item Currently determining if precipitation and temperature are strong drivers of bee-flower interaction turnover.
