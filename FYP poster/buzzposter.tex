     %Brief Introduction explaining broader significance of research problem and the gap in knowledge that is being addressed
     Bee-flower interactions differ drastically between subsequent seasons or even weeks. However, this high interaction turnover has been largely overlooked by previous studies, which assume a static picture of pollination networks. Understanding how and why bee-flower interactions vary over time is crucial in the conservation of bees, and in the continuation of their pollination services. Moreover, climate change can result in fluctuating flowering times, thereafter indirectly sabotaging bee-flower interactions. \\

    \item Does temperature, precipitation or humidity affect bee-flower interaction turnover?
    \item Do bee-flower interaction turnover rates differ between seasons?
    \item Do bee-flower interaction turnover rates of the tropics differ from those of the temperate regions?

    where:    
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=5pt,topsep=5pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt, leftmargin=20pt]
     \item $a$ is the number of interactions shared between the two networks  
    \item $b$ and $c$ are the number of unique interactions in the two networks
    \end{itemize}
 
 $\boldsymbol{ \beta_{int}}$ ranges from 0 to 1; a higher $\boldsymbol{ \beta_{int}}$ reflects a higher difference between monthly networks.

    \item Monthly bee-flower interaction turnover is high.
    \item There are no significant differences between turnover rates within seasons and between seasons.
    \item There are significant differences between turnover rates in the tropics and in temperate regions.

    \item If climate does not affect bee-flower interaction turnover, other factors to be considered include bee body size and lifespan.
