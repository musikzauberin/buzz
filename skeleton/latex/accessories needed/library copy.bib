abstract = {The occurrence of oscillatory behaviours in living cells can be viewed as a visible consequence of stable, regulatory homeostatic cycles. Therefore, they may be used as experimental windows on the underlying physiological mechanisms. Recent studies show that growing pollen tubes are an excellent biological model for these purposes. They unite experimental simplicity with clear oscillatory patterns of both structural and temporal features, most being measurable during real-time in live cells. There is evidence that these cellular oscillators involve an integrated input of plasma membrane ion fluxes, and a cytosolic choreography of protons, calcium and, most likely, potassium and chloride. In turn, these can create positive feedback regulation loops that are able to generate and self-sustain a number of spatial and temporal patterns. Other features, including cell wall assembly and rheology, turgor, and the cytoskeleton, play important roles and are targets or modulators of ion dynamics. Many of these features have similarities with other cell types, notably with apical-growing cells. Pollen tubes may thus serve as a powerful model for exploring the basis of cell growth and morphogenesis. BioEssays 23:86-94, 2001.},

abstract = {Ferritin is one of the major proteins of iron metabolism. It is almost ubiquitous and tightly regulated by the metal. Biochemical and structural properties of the ferritins are largely conserved from bacteria to man, although the role in the regulation of iron trafficking varies in the different organisms. Recent studies have clarified some of the major aspects of the reaction between iron and ferritin, which results in the formation of the iron core and production of hydrogen peroxide. The characterization of cellular models in which ferritin expression is modulated has shown that the ferroxidase catalytic site on the H-chain has a central role in regulating iron availability. In turn, this has secondary effects on a number of cellular activities, which include proliferation and resistance to oxidative damage. Moreover, the response to apoptotic stimuli is affected by H-ferritin expression. Altered ferritin L-chain expression has been found in at least two types of genetic disorders, although its role in the determination of the pathology has not been fully clarified. The recent discovery of a new ferritin specific for the mitochondria, which is functionally similar to the H-ferritin, opens new perspectives in the study of the relationships between iron, oxidative damage and free radicals.},

abstract = {Since the first recordings of single potassium channel activities in the plasma membrane of guard cells more than 25 years ago, patch-clamp studies discovered a variety of ion channels in all cell types and plant species under inspection. Their properties differed in a cell type- and cell membrane-dependent manner. Guard cells, for which the existence of plant potassium channels was initially documented, advanced to a versatile model system for studying plant ion channel structure, function, and physiology. Interestingly, one of the first identified potassium-channel genes encoding the Shaker-type channel KAT1 was shown to be highly expressed in guard cells. KAT1-type channels from Arabidopsis thaliana and its homologs from other species were found to encode the K(+)-selective inward rectifiers that had already been recorded in early patch-clamp studies with guard cells. Within the genome era, additional Arabidopsis Shaker-type channels appeared. All nine members of the Arabidopsis Shaker family are localized at the plasma membrane, where they either operate as inward rectifiers, outward rectifiers, weak voltage-dependent channels, or electrically silent, but modulatory subunits. The vacuole membrane, in contrast, harbors a set of two-pore K(+) channels. Just very recently, two plant anion channel families of the SLAC/SLAH and ALMT/QUAC type were identified. SLAC1/SLAH3 and QUAC1 are expressed in guard cells and mediate Slow- and Rapid-type anion currents, respectively, that are involved in volume and turgor regulation. Anion channels in guard cells and other plant cells are key targets within often complex signaling networks. Here, the present knowledge is reviewed for the plant ion channel biology. Special emphasis is drawn to the molecular mechanisms of channel regulation, in the context of model systems and in the light of evolution.},

This terminal differentiation event involves cell cycle exit, cell fusion and the differential regulation of genes expressed in the larval versus adult hypodermis, lin-29 is the most downstream gene in the developmental timing pathway and thus it is the most direct known regulator of these diverse processes, We show that lin-29 encodes a protein with five zinc fingers of the (Cys)(2)-(HiS)(2) class and thus likely controls these processes by regulating transcription in a stage-specific manner, Consistent with this role, a lin-29 fusion protein binds in vitro to the 5' regulatory sequences necessary in vivo for expression of col-19, a collagen gene expressed in the adult hypodermis. lin-29 mRNA is detected in the first larval stage and increases in abundance through subsequent larval stages until the final molt, w hen lin-29 activity is required for terminal differentiation.},

abstract = {Pollen tubes are a good model for the study of cell growth and morphogenesis because of their extreme elongation without cell division. Yet, knowledge about the genetic basis of pollen germination and tube growth is still lagging behind advances in pollen physiology and biochemistry. In an effort to reduce this gap, we have developed a new method to obtain highly purified, hydrated pollen grains of Arabidopsis through flowcytometric sorting, and we used GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA; representing approximately 8,200 genes) to compare the transcriptional profile of sorted pollen with those of four vegetative tissues (seedlings, leaves, roots, and siliques). We present a new graphical tool allowing genomic scale visualization of the unique transcriptional profile of pollen. The 1,584 genes expressed in pollen showed a 90{\%} overlap with genes expressed in these vegetative tissues, whereas one-third of the genes constitutively expressed in the vegetative tissues were not expressed in pollen. Among the 469 genes enriched in pollen, 162 were selectively expressed, and most of these had not been associated previously with pollen. Their functional classification reveals several new candidate genes, mainly in the categories of signal transduction and cell wall biosynthesis and regulation. Thus, the results presented improve our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying pollen germination and tube growth and provide new directions for deciphering their genetic basis. Because pollen expresses about one-third of the number of genes expressed on average in other organs, it may constitute an ideal system to study fundamental mechanisms of cell biology and, by omission, of cell division.},

abstract = {Flowering plant reproduction requires precise delivery of the sperm cells to the ovule by a pollen tube. Guidance signals from female cells are being identified; however, how pollen responds to those cues is largely unknown. Here, we show that two predicted cation/proton exchangers (CHX) in Arabidopsis thaliana, CHX21 and CHX23, are essential for pollen tube guidance. Male fertility was unchanged in single chx21 or chx23 mutants. However, fertility was impaired in chx21 chx23 double mutant pollen. Wild-type pistils pollinated with a limited number of single and double mutant pollen producing 62{\%} fewer seeds than those pollinated with chx23 single mutant pollen, indicating that chx21 chx23 pollen is severely compromised. Double mutant pollen grains germinated and grew tubes down the transmitting tract, but the tubes failed to turn toward ovules. Furthermore, chx21 chx23 pollen tubes failed to enter the micropyle of excised ovules. Green fluorescent protein-tagged CHX23 driven by its native promoter was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of pollen tubes. CHX23 mediated K(+) transport, as CHX23 expression in Escherichia coli increased K(+) uptake and growth in a pH-dependent manner. We propose that by modifying localized cation balance and pH, these transporters could affect steps in signal reception and/or transduction that are critical to shifting the axis of polarity and directing pollen growth toward the ovule.},

abstract = {The inherent interest on the origin of genetic novelties can be traced back to Darwin. But it was not until recently that we were allowed to investigate the fundamental process of origin of new genes by the studies on newly evolved Young genes. Two indispensible steps are involved in this process: origin of new gene copies through various mutational mechanisms and evolution of novel functions, which further more leads to fixation of the new copies within populations. The theoretical framework for the former step formed in 1970s. Ohno proposed gene duplication as the most important mechanism producing new gene copies. He also believed that the most common fate for new gene copies is to become pseudogenes. This classical view was validated and was also challenged by the characterization of the first functional young gene jingwei in Drosophila. Recent genome-wide comparison on young genes of Drosophila has elucidated a comprehensive picture addressing remarkable roles of various mechanisms besides gene duplication during origin of new genes. Case surveys revealed it is not rare that new genes Would evolve novel structures and functions to contribute to the adaptive evolution of organisms. Here. we review recent advances in understanding how new genes originated and evolved on the basis of genome-wide results and experimental efforts on cases. We would finally discuss the future directions of this fast-growing research field in the Context of functional genomics era.},

abstract = {Skin color is one of the most conspicuous ways in which humans vary and has been widely used to define human races. Here we present new evidence indicating that variations in skin color are adaptive, and are related to the regulation of ultraviolet (UV) radiation penetration in the integument and its direct and indirect effects on fitness. Using remotely sensed data on UV radiation levels, hypotheses concerning the distribution of the skin colors of indigenous peoples relative to UV levels were tested quantitatively in this study for the first time. The major results of this study are: (1) skin reflectance is strongly correlated with absolute latitude and UV radiation levels. The highest correlation between skin reflectance and UV levels was observed at 545 nm, near the absorption maximum for oxyhemoglobin, suggesting that the main role of melanin pigmentation in humans is regulation of the effects of UV radiation on the contents of cutaneous blood vessels located in the dermis. (2) Predicted skin reflectances deviated little from observed values. (3) In all populations for which skin reflectance data were available for males and females, females were found to be lighter skinned than males. (4) The clinal gradation of skin coloration observed among indigenous peoples is correlated with UV radiation levels and represents a compromise solution to the conflicting physiological requirements of photoprotection and vitamin D synthesis. The earliest members of the hominid lineage probably had a mostly unpigmented or lightly pigmented integument covered with dark black hair, similar to that of the modern chimpanzee. The evolution of a naked, darkly pigmented integument occurred early in the evolution of the genus Homo. A dark epidermis protected swear glands from W-induced injury, thus insuring the integrity of somatic thermoregulation. Of greater significance to individual reproductive success was that highly melanized skin protected against W-induced photolysis of folate (Branda {\&} Eaten, 1978, Science 201, 625-626; Jablonski, 1992, Proc. Australas. Sec. Hum. Biol. 5, 455-462, 1999, Med. Hypotheses 52, 581-582), a metabolite essential for normal development of the embryonic neural tube (Bower {\&} Stanley, 1989, The Medical Journal of Australia 150, 613-619; Medical Research Council Vitamin Research Group, 1991, The Lancer 338, 31-37) and spermatogenesis (Cosentino er al., 1990, Proc. Natn. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 1431-1435; Mathur et al., 1977, Fertility Sterility 28, 1356-1360). As hominids migrated outside of the tropics, varying degrees of depigmentation evolved in order to permit WE-induced synthesis of previtamin D-3. The lighter color of female skin may be required to permit synthesis of the relatively higher amounts of vitamin D-3 necessary during pregnancy and lactation. Skin coloration in humans is adaptive and labile. Skin pigmentation levels have changed more than once in human evolution. Because of this, skin coloration is of no value in determining phylogenetic relationships among modern human groups. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Social class differences in height have been recognised for many centuries. However, few studies have examined the extent to which these differences are made up of differences in leg length or trunk length. This paper reanalyses cross-sectional information on children examined in Britain in the 1930s. We assess associations between socioeconomic status and diet and the components of childhood stature. The analyses were based on the records of 2990 children aged 2 years to 14 years 9 months who were examined in the Carnegie (Boyd Orr) survey of diet and health (1937-39). z-Scores for the measures of childhood stature were calculated using polynomial regression techniques with the study population as the standard. Univariable and multivariable statistical techniques were used to assess the relationships between childhood height, leg length and trunk length, and dietary and socio-economic factors measured at the level of the household. Leg length was the component of stature most strongly associated with measures of childhood diet and socio-economic status. A greater part of the difference in stature between socio-economic groups was caused by differences in leg length rather than trunk length. In multiple regression analyses, district of residence and family food expenditure were generally the two factors most strongly related to stature. In a subsample of the surveyed children, for whom birthweight information was available, trunk length and leg length were equally strongly related to birthweight. Leg length appears to be a particularly sensitive indicator of childhood socio-economic circumstances. Although contemporary studies highlight the importance of biological factors in determining childhood height, the data analysed in this study suggest that socio-economic circumstances were also important in explaining height differentials in prewar Britain.},

abstract = {We outline three very different concepts of the gene—instrumental, nominal, and postgenomic. The instrumental gene has a critical role in the construction and interpretation of experiments in which the relationship between genotype and phenotype is explored via hybridization between organisms or directly between nucleic acid molecules. It also plays an important theoretical role in the foundations of disciplines such as quantitative genetics and population genetics. The nominal gene is a critical practical tool, allowing stable communication between bioscientists in a wide range of fields grounded in well-defined sequences of nucleotides, but this concept does not embody major theoretical insights into genome structure or function. The post-genomic gene embodies the continuing project of understanding how genome structure supports genome function, but with a deflationary picture of the gene as a structural unit. This final concept of the gene poses a significant challenge to conventional assumptions about the relationship between genome structure and function, and between genotype and phenotype.},

Fourteen out of 200 tested in the Ames assay showed positive effects and 54 out of 242 were positive in the chromosome test. Three additives (erythorbic acid, chlorine dioxide and beet red) were positive only in the Ames test, although their mutagenic potentials were relatively weak, while 43 additives were positive only in the chromosome test. Eleven additives (calcium hypochlorite, cinnamic aldehyde, l -cysteine monohydrochloride, Food Green No. 3 (Fast Green FCF), hydrogen peroxide, potassium bromate, sodium chlorite, sodium hypochlorite, sodium nitrite, cacao pigment and caramel) were positive in both the Ames test and the chromosome test. The usefulness of such primary screening tests combining two different genetic end-points, gene mutation and chromosomal aberration, and some correlation between mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of food additives are discussed.},

@misc{Boavida2005,
abstract = {The evolutionary success of higher plants relies on a very short gametophytic phase, which underlies the sexual reproduction cycle. Sexual plant reproduction takes place in special organs of the flower: pollen, the male gametophyte, is released from the anthers and then adheres, grows and interacts along various tissues of the female organs, collectively known as the pistil. Finally, it fertilizes the female gametophyte, the embryo sac. Pollen is released as bi or tricellular, highly de-hydrated and presumably containing all the biochemical components and transcripts to germinate. Upon hydration on the female tissues, it develops a cytoplasmic extension, the pollen tube, which is one of the fastest growing cells in nature. Pollen is completely "ready-to-go", but despite this seemingly simple reaction, very complex interactions take place with the female tissues. In higher animals, genetic mechanisms for sex determination establish striking developmental differences between males and females. In contrast, most higher plant species develop both male and female structures within the same flower, allowing self-fertilization. Outcrossing is ensured by self-incompatibility mechanisms, which evolved under precise genetic control, controlling self-recognition and cell-to-cell interaction. Equally important is pollen selection along the female tissues, where interactions between different cell types with inherent signalling properties correspond to check-points to ensure fertilization. Last but not least, pollen-pistil interaction occurs in a way that enables the correct targeting of the pollen tubes to the receptive ovules. In this review, we cover the basic mechanisms underlying sexual plant reproduction, from the structural and cellular determinants, to the most recent genetic advances.},

All three methods were able to detect the effects of MNNG but with a clear difference in sensitivity. At low concentrations of MNNG the most sensitive method appeared to be the comet assay. After the short-term treatment the comet assay was able to detect the lesions induced by MNNG at approx. 0.1 mu g/ml, alkaline elution of DNA at 1 mu g/ml and DNA unwinding at 1-2 mu g/ml. MNNG treated VH10 cells, human lymphocytes and V79 cells were also tested cytogenetically, confirming that MNNG induced chromosomal aberrations at concentrations > 1 mu g/ml in VH10 cells (short-term treatment); > 0.2 mu g/ml in V79 cells (long-term treatment) and > 8 mu g/ml in human lymphocytes (long-term treatment). In some experiments we tried to increase the level of MNNG-induced DNA breaks with help of DNA repair inhibitors cytosine arabinoside (Ara C) and hydroxyurea (HU) which were applied either after or during MNNG treatment. Our results showed that the level of MNNG-induced lesions was increased by simultaneous treatment of cells with MNNG and Ara C and HU. 2 x 10(-5) M Ara C and 2 x 10(-3) M HU were as effective as 10-times higher concentrations of inhibitors. Ara C and HU increased the level of MNNG-induced DNA breaks mainly in combination with lower concentrations of MNNG (< 2 mu g/ml). Rejoining of DNA breaks was observed in human cells VH10 and Hep G2 as well as in Chinese hamster cells V79 damaged by both lower and higher MNNG-concentrations. All methods showed that MNNG-induced DNA breaks had been gradually rejoined.},

abstract = {Patch-clamp whole-cell and single-channel recording techniques were used to investigate the regulation of outward K(+) channels by external and internal protons in Brassica chinensispollen protoplasts. Outward K(+) currents and conductance were insensitive to external pH (pH(o)) except at pH 4.5. Maximal conductance (G(max)) for the outward K(+) currents was inhibited at acidic external pH. Half-activation voltage ( E(1/2)) for the outward K(+) currents shifted to more positive voltages along with the decrease in pH(o). E(1/2) can be described by a modified Henderson-Hasselbalch equation expected from a single titratable binding site. The activation kinetics of the outward K(+) channels was largely insensitive to pH(o). An internal pH (pH(i)) of 4.5 significantly increased outward K(+) currents and conductance. G(max) for the outward K(+) currents decreased with elevations in pH(i). In contrast to the effect of pH(o), E(1/2) was shifted to more positive voltages with elevations in pH(i). The outward K(+) currents, G(max) and E(1/2) can be described by the modified Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Furthermore, acidifying pH(i) accelerated the activation of the outward K(+) currents significantly. The differences in electro-physiological properties among previously reported and currently described plant outward K(+) channels may reflect differences in the structure of these channels.},

abstract = {raf oncogenes were shown to act synergistically with myc in transformation. The contribution of myc was identified as that of a "second messenger" in signal transduction of at least some, competence inducing, growth factors. The role of raf appears to be that of a cytosolic ser/thr specific protein kinase which was placed downstream of ras in the signal transduction of serum growth factors by ras and raf antibody microinjection experiments. Because of the inability of raf to abrogate a cells need for myc inducing competence factors, as well as its synergistic effect with myc, raf was placed downstream of ras in the progression pathway of cellular growth control. We speculate that the basis for synergism with myc might be the ability of raf to activate competence factor induced myc protein or a myc induced protein by phosphorylation. The role of raf in lung tumors was examined by the development of a high incidence mouse model system using ethylnitrosourea as carcinogen and butylated hydroxytoluene as promoter. raf proteins of normal size were expressed at high levels, raf protein vaccination was apparently effective in eliminating the promoted phase of tumor induction.},

abstract = {1. We investigated experimentally predation by the flatworm Dugesia lugubris on the snail Physa acuta in relation to predator body length and to prey morphology [shell length (SL) and aperture width (AW)]. 2. SL and AW correlate strongly in the field, but display significant and independent variance among populations. In the laboratory, predation by Dugesia resulted in large and significant selection differentials on both SL and AW. Analysis of partial effects suggests that selection on AW was indirect, and mediated through its strong correlation with SL. 3. The probability P<sub>ij</sub> for a snail of size category i (SL) to be preyed upon by a flatworm of size category j was fitted with a Poisson-probability distribution, the mean of which increased linearly with predator size (j). Despite the low number of parameters, the fit was excellent (r<sup>2</sup>=0.96). We offer brief biological interpretations of this relationship with reference to optimal foraging theory. 4. The largest size class of Dugesia (>2 cm) did not prey on snails larger than 7 mm shell length. This size threshold might offer Physa a refuge against flatworm predation and thereby allow coexistence in the field. 5. Our results are further discussed with respect to previous field and laboratory observations on P. acuta life-history patterns, in particular its phenotypic variance in adult body size.

abstract = {$\beta$-Galactosidase (lacZ) has bifunctional activity. It hydrolyzes lactose to galactose and glucose and catalyzes the intramolecular isomerization of lactose to allolactose, the lac operon inducer. $\beta$-Galactosidase promotes the isomerization by means of an acceptor site that binds glucose after its cleavage from lactose and thus delays its exit from the site. However, because of its relatively low affinity for glucose, details of this site have remained elusive. We present structural data mapping the glucose site based on a substituted enzyme (G794A-$\beta$-galactosidase) that traps allolactose. Various lines of evidence indicate that the glucose of the trapped allolactose is in the acceptor position. The evidence includes structures with Bis-Tris (2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-2,2',2″-nitrilotriethanol) and L-ribose in the site and kinetic binding studies with substituted $\beta$-galactosidases. The site is composed of Asn-102, His-418, Lys-517, Ser-796, Glu-797, and Trp-999. Ser-796 and Glu-797 are part of a loop (residues 795-803) that closes over the active site. This loop appears essential for the bifunctional nature of the enzyme because it helps form the glucose binding site. In addition, because the loop is mobile, glucose binding is transient, allowing the release of some glucose. Bioinformatics studies showed that the residues important for interacting with glucose are only conserved in a subset of related enzymes. Thus, intramolecular isomerization is not a universal feature of $\beta$-galactosidases. Genomic analyses indicated that lac repressors were co-selected only within the conserved subset. This shows that the glucose binding site of $\beta$-galactosidase played an important role in lac operon evolution.},

abstract = {UEV proteins are enzymatically inactive variants of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes that regulate noncanonical elongation of ubiquitin chains. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, UEV is part of the RAD6-mediated error-free DNA repair pathway. In mammalian cells, UEV proteins can modulate c-FOS transcription and the G2-M transition of the cell cycle. Here we show that the UEV genes from phylogenetically distant organisms present a remarkable conservation in their exon-intron structure. We also show that the human UEV1 gene is fused with the previously unknown gene Kua. In Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, Kua and UEV are in separated Loci, and are expressed as independent transcripts and proteins. In humans, Kua and UEV1 are adjacent genes, expressed either as separate transcripts encoding independent Kua and UEV1 proteins, or as a hybrid Kua-UEV transcript, encoding a two-domain protein. Kua proteins represent a novel class of conserved proteins with juxtamembrane histidine-rich motifs. Experiments with epitope-tagged proteins show that UEV1A is a nuclear protein, whereas both Kua and Kua-UEV localize to cytoplasmic structures, indicating that the Kua domain determines the cytoplasmic localization of Kua-UEV. Therefore, the addition of a Kua domain to UEV in the fused Kua-UEV protein confers new biological properties to this regulator of variant polyubiquitination.},

abstract = {There are currently intensive global research efforts aimed at increasing and modifying the accumulation of lipids, alcohols, hydrocarbons, polysaccharides, and other energy storage compounds in photosynthetic organisms, yeast, and bacteria through genetic engineering. Many improvements have been realized, including increased lipid and carbohydrate production, improved H(2) yields, and the diversion of central metabolic intermediates into fungible biofuels. Photosynthetic microorganisms are attracting considerable interest within these efforts due to their relatively high photosynthetic conversion efficiencies, diverse metabolic capabilities, superior growth rates, and ability to store or secrete energy-rich hydrocarbons. Relative to cyanobacteria, eukaryotic microalgae possess several unique metabolic attributes of relevance to biofuel production, including the accumulation of significant quantities of triacylglycerol; the synthesis of storage starch (amylopectin and amylose), which is similar to that found in higher plants; and the ability to efficiently couple photosynthetic electron transport to H(2) production. Although the application of genetic engineering to improve energy production phenotypes in eukaryotic microalgae is in its infancy, significant advances in the development of genetic manipulation tools have recently been achieved with microalgal model systems and are being used to manipulate central carbon metabolism in these organisms. It is likely that many of these advances can be extended to industrially relevant organisms. This review is focused on potential avenues of genetic engineering that may be undertaken in order to improve microalgae as a biofuel platform for the production of biohydrogen, starch-derived alcohols, diesel fuel surrogates, and/or alkanes.},

abstract = {We present a genome-wide view of the male gametophytic transcriptome in Arabidopsis based on microarray analysis. In comparison with the transcriptome of the sporophyte throughout development, the pollen transcriptome showed reduced complexity and a unique composition. We identified 992 pollen-expressed mRNAs, nearly 40{\%} of which were detected specifically in pollen. Analysis of the functional composition of the pollen transcriptome revealed the over-representation of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cell wall metabolism, cytoskeleton, and signaling and under-representation of mRNAs involved in transcription and protein synthesis. For several gene families, we observed a common pattern of mutually exclusive gene expression between pollen and sporophytic tissues for different gene family members. Our results provide a 50-fold increase in the knowledge of genes expressed in Arabidopsis pollen. Moreover, we also detail the extensive overlap (61{\%}) of the pollen transcriptome with that of the sporophyte, which provides ample potential to influence sporophytic fitness through gametophytic selection.},

abstract = {Intraspecific and interspecific communication and recognition depend on olfaction in widely diverse species of animals. Olfaction, an ancient sensory modality, is based on principles of neural organization and function that appear to be remarkably similar throughout the zoosphere. Thus, the "primitives" of olfactory stimuli that determine the input information of olfaction, the kinds of "molecular images" formed at various levels in the olfactory pathway, and the cellular mechanisms that underlie olfactory information processing are comparable in invertebrates and vertebrates alike. A case in point is the male-specific olfactory subsystem in moths, which is specialized to detect and analyze the qualitative, quantitative, and temporal features of the con-specific females' sex-pheromonal chemical signal. This olfactory subsystem can be viewed, and is here presented, as a model in which common principles of organization and function of olfactory systems in general are exaggerated to serve the requirements of a chemical communication system that is crucial for reproductive success.},

abstract = {Most primates live in social groups in which affiliative bonds exist between individuals. Because these bonds need to be maintained through social interactions (grooming in most primates), sociality will be limited by time constraints. It has previously been shown that the time primates invest in grooming increases with group size. However, when groups become too large, individuals will not have enough time available to service all possible social relationships and group cohesion is expected to decrease. In this study, we used data from previously published studies to determine how large groups compromise on their grooming time and how ecological, phylogenetic and life history variables affect time invested in grooming (across species as well as within taxa). We used path analysis to analyse direct and indirect (via group size) effects on grooming. We showed that not only is grooming time determined by group size, but it is also affected by dispersal patterns and sex ratio. Furthermore, we found that grooming time is asymptotic when group size exceeds 40 individuals, indicating that time constraints resulting from ecological pressure force individuals to compromise on their grooming time. This was true across species, but a similar effect was also found within taxa. Cognitive constraints and predation pressure strongly affect group sizes and thereby have an indirect effect on primate grooming time. Primates that were found to live in groups larger than predicted by their neocortex size usually suffered from greater predation risk. However, most populations in our analysis were placed well within what we define as their eco-cognitive niche.},

abstract = {The assembly, sorting signals, and turnover of the tonoplast potassium channel AtTPK1 of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were studied. We used transgenic Arabidopsis expressing a TPK1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion or protoplasts transiently transformed with chimeric constructs based on domain exchange between TPK1 and TPK4, the only TPK family member not located at the tonoplast. The results show that TPK1-GFP is a dimer and that the newly synthesized polypeptides transiently interact with a thus-far unidentified 20-kD polypeptide. A subset of the TPK1-TPK4 chimeras were unable to assemble correctly and these remained located in the endoplasmic reticulum where they interacted with the binding protein chaperone. Therefore, TPK1 must assemble correctly to pass endoplasmic reticulum quality control. Substitution of the cytosolic C terminus of TPK4 with the corresponding domain of TPK1 was sufficient to allow tonoplast delivery, indicating that this domain contains tonoplast sorting information. Pulse-chase labeling indicated that TPK1-GFP has a half-life of at least 24 h. Turnover of the fusion protein involves internalization into the vacuole where the GFP domain is released. This indicates a possible mechanism for the turnover of tonoplast proteins.},

abstract = {Nutrient sensing is critical for plant adaptation to the environment. Because of extensive farming and erosion, low content of mineral nutrients such as potassium (K(+)) in soils becomes a limiting factor for plant growth. In response to low-K conditions, plants enhance their capability of K(+) uptake through an unknown signaling mechanism. Here we report the identification of a Ca(2+)-dependent pathway for low-K response in Arabidopsis. We are not aware of any other example of a molecular pathway for a nutrient response in plants. Earlier genetic analyses revealed three genes encoding two Ca(2+) sensors (CBL1 and CBL9) and their target protein kinase (CIPK23) to be critical for plant growth on low-K media and for stomatal regulation, indicating that these calcium signaling components participate in the low-K response and turgor regulation. In this study, we show that the protein kinase CIPK23 interacted with, and phosphorylated, a voltage-gated inward K(+) channel (AKT1) required for K(+) acquisition in Arabidopsis. In the Xenopus oocyte system, our studies showed that interacting calcium sensors (CBL1 and CBL9) together with target kinase CIPK23, but not either component alone, activated the AKT1 channel in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, connecting the Ca(2+) signal to enhanced K(+) uptake through activation of a K(+) channel. Disruption of both CBL1 and CBL9 or CIPK23 gene in Arabidopsis reduced the AKT1 activity in the mutant roots, confirming that the Ca(2+)-CBL-CIPK pathway functions to orchestrate transporting activities in planta according to external K(+) availability.},

We have examined the-patterns of odorant receptor expression in the rat olfactory epithelium to determine whether the mammalian olfactory system employs spatial segregation of sensory input to encode the identity of an odorant stimulus. In situ hybridization experiments with probes for 11 different odorant receptors demonstrate that sensory neurons expressing distinct receptors are topologically segregated into a small number of broad, yet circumscribed, zones within the olfactory epithelium. Within a given zone, however, olfactory neurons expressing a specific receptor appear to be randomly distributed, rather than spatially localized. The complex mammalian olfactory system may therefore compartmentalize the epithelium into anatomically and functionally discrete units, such that each zone expresses only a subset of the entire receptor repertoire.},

Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication, followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications, giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25,498 genes encoding proteins from 11,000 families, similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans--the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families, indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes. This is the first complete genome sequence of a plant and provides the foundations for more comprehensive comparison of conserved processes in all eukaryotes, identifying a wide range of plant-specific gene functions and establishing rapid systematic ways to identify genes for crop improvement.},

Proteins NHX1 and NHX2 are the two major tonoplast-localized NHX isoforms. Here, we show that NHX1 and NHX2 have similar expression patterns and identical biochemical activity, and together they account for a significant amount of the Na(+),K(+)/H(+) antiport activity in tonoplast vesicles. Reverse genetics showed functional redundancy of NHX1 and NHX2 genes. Growth of the double mutant nhx1 nhx2 was severely impaired, and plants were extremely sensitive to external K(+). By contrast, nhx1 nhx2 mutants showed similar sensitivity to salinity stress and even greater rates of Na(+) sequestration than the wild type. Double mutants had reduced ability to create the vacuolar K(+) pool, which in turn provoked greater K(+) retention in the cytosol, impaired osmoregulation, and compromised turgor generation for cell expansion. Genes NHX1 and NHX2 were highly expressed in guard cells, and stomatal function was defective in mutant plants, further compromising their ability to regulate water relations. Together, these results show that tonoplast-localized NHX proteins are essential for active K(+) uptake at the tonoplast, for turgor regulation, and for stomatal function.},

abstract = {Movements of marked individuals of Nerita atramentosa Reeve, Austrocochlea constricta (Lamarck), Bembicium nanum (Lamarck), and Cellana tramoserica (Sowerby) were recorded at various sites in New South Wales in 1974 and 1975. A model of random movements during feeding at high tide was proposed, i.e., that animals wandered in random directions and the distances moved were exponentially distributed. Appropriate statistical tests for departures from such a model are given. The types of departure tested were non-random directions, non-exponentially distributed dis- tances, different distances in different directions, and correlated distances or directions of movement between days. With two exceptions, the movements of the animals over short periods were adequa- tely described by the assumption of random movements. One exception was A. constricta in one locality where movements of the sample were limited by it being in a large rock-pool and the other was the limpet C. tramoserica which displayed homing behaviour, so that the population could be divided into homers and non-homers. Movements of non-homing limpets were random. The mean distance moved by N. atramentosa was not significantly different from that of A. con- stricta. The mean distances moved by these two species were greater than those of B. nanum and the non-homing C. tramoserica, which were not different from each other. Adult and one-year old N. atramentosa did not differ significantly in mean distance moved, but both moved more than juveni- les. These patterns of movement are discussed with respect to hypotheses about feeding in these species. The model of movement was used to predict the effect of different percentage cover in small pools on the movement of A. constricta, which shows a preference for this micro-habitat. Increased availability of small pools reduced the mean distance moved by this species.},

In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true.

Arabidopsis shy3-1 mu- tant plants have a short hypocotyl, small leaves, and a short flowering stem, and these defects result from decreased cell expansion. The semidominant shy3-1 mutation changes an amino acid in KT2/KUP2, a K ? transporter related to the Escherichia coli Kup protein. Second mutations in the KT2/KUP2/SHY3 gene, including presumed null mutations, sup- press the shy3-1 phenotypes. Plants with these intragenic suppressor mutations appear similar to wild-type plants, suggesting that KT2/KUP2/SHY3 acts redundantly with other genes. Expression of the shy3-1 mutant version of KT2/ KUP2/SHY3 in wild-type plants confers shy3-1 –like phenotypes, indicating that shy3-1 probably either causes a gain of function or creates an interfering protein. The shy3-1 mutation does not eliminate the ability of the KT2/KUP2 cDNA to rescue the growth of a potassium transport-deficient E. coli mutant. A P SHY3 :: GUS fusion is expressed in growing portions of the plant. These results suggest that KT2/KUP2/SHY3 mediates K ? -dependent cell expansion in growing tissues.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The haploid male gametophyte generation of flowering plants consists of two- or three-celled pollen grains. This functional specialization is thought to be a key factor in the evolutionary success of flowering plants. Moreover, pollen ontogeny is also an attractive model in which to dissect cellular networks that control cell growth, asymmetric cell division and cellular differentiation. Our objective, and an essential step towards the detailed understanding of these processes, was to comprehensively define the male haploid transcriptome throughout development. RESULTS: We have developed staged spore isolation procedures for Arabidopsis and used Affymetrix ATH1 genome arrays to identify a total of 13,977 male gametophyte-expressed mRNAs, 9.7{\%} of which were male-gametophyte-specific. The transition from bicellular to tricellular pollen was accompanied by a decline in the number of diverse mRNA species and an increase in the proportion of male gametophyte-specific transcripts. Expression profiles of regulatory proteins and distinct clusters of coexpressed genes were identified that could correspond to components of gametophytic regulatory networks. Moreover, integration of transcriptome and experimental data revealed the early synthesis of translation factors and their requirement to support pollen tube growth. CONCLUSIONS: The progression from proliferating microspores to terminally differentiated pollen is characterized by large-scale repression of early program genes and the activation of a unique late gene-expression program in maturing pollen. These data provide a quantum increase in knowledge concerning gametophytic transcription and lay the foundations for new genomic-led studies of the regulatory networks and cellular functions that operate to specify male gametophyte development.},

@article{Michard2005b,
abstract = {Among all voltage-gated K+ channels from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the weakly rectifying K+ channel (K(weak) channel) AKT2 displays unique gating properties. AKT2 is exceptionally regulated by phosphorylation: when nonphosphorylated AKT2 behaves as an inward-rectifying potassium channel; phosphorylation of AKT2 abolishes inward rectification by shifting its activation threshold far positive (>200 mV) so that it closes only at voltages positive of +100 mV. In its phosphorylated form, AKT2 is thus locked in the open state in the entire physiological voltage range. To understand the molecular grounds of this unique gating behavior, we generated chimeras between AKT2 and the conventional inward-rectifying channel KAT1. The transfer of the pore from KAT1 to AKT2 altered the permeation properties of the channel. However, the gating properties were unaffected, suggesting that the pore region of AKT2 is not responsible for the unique K(weak) gating. Instead, a lysine residue in S4, highly conserved among all K(weak) channels but absent from other plant K+ channels, was pinpointed in a site-directed mutagenesis approach. Substitution of the lysine by serine or aspartate abolished the "open-lock" characteristic and converted AKT2 into an inward-rectifying channel. Interestingly, phosphoregulation of the mutant AKT2-K197S appeared to be similar to that of the K(in) channel KAT1: as suggested by mimicking the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated states, phosphorylation induced a shift of the activation threshold of AKT2-K197S by about +50 mV. We conclude that the lysine residue K197 sensitizes AKT2 to phosphoregulation. The phosphorylation-induced reduction of the activation energy in AKT2 is approximately 6 kT larger than in the K197S mutant. It is discussed that this hypersensitive response of AKT2 to phosphorylation equips a cell with the versatility to establish a potassium gradient and to make efficient use of it.},

abstract = {Females are generally assumed to prefer larger, more dominant males. However, a growing number of studies that control for male-male competition have shown no correlation between dominance and attractiveness. Aggressive males can interfere with female mate preference either by physically coercing females into mating or by driving submissive males away and restricting mate choice. The most common method of assessing female mate choice is by using simultaneous two-choice tests. These control for male-male interactions, but usually interfere with physical and chemical cues involved in mate selection or alter male behaviour. They are therefore unsuitable for many study species, especially insects. Another method is the no-choice test that measures a females latency to mating when placed with a single male as an indication of male attractiveness. No-choice tests control for male-male aggression while allowing full contact between pairs (they allow actual mating to be directly observed rather than to occur based on a correlated behaviour). So far, however, no study has confirmed that males that entice females to mate sooner actually enjoy increased longer-term mating success. As such, the accuracy of no-choice tests as a method of examining mate choice remains untested. Here, we used no-choice tests on the black field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus, to show that (1) females did not prefer males that won fights ("dominant" males), and (2) latency to mating predicts actual mating success. We have clearly demonstrated the usefulness of no-choice tests and, considering the advantages of this method, they should be more often considered for a wider variety of taxa.},

abstract = {The availability of potassium to the plant is highly variable, due to complex soil dynamics, which are strongly influenced by root-soil interactions. A low plant potassium status triggers expression of high affinity K+ transporters, up-regulates some K+ channels, and activates signalling cascades, some of which are similar to those involved in wounding and other stress responses. The molecules that signal low K+ status in plants include reactive oxygen species and phytohormones, such as auxin, ethylene and jasmonic acid. Apart from up-regulation of transport proteins and adjustment of metabolic processes, potassium deprivation triggers developmental responses in roots. All these acclimation strategies enable plants to survive and compete for nutrients in a dynamic environment with a variable availability of potassium.},

abstract = {Mutant analysis represents one of the most reliable approaches to identifying genes involved in plant development. The screening of the Versailles collection of Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA insertion transformants has allowed us to isolate different mutations affecting male gametophytic functions and viability. Among several mutated lines, five have been extensively studied at the genetic, molecular, and cytological levels. For each mutant, several generations of selfing and outcrossing have been carried out, leading to the conclusion that all these mutations are tagged and affect only the male gametophyte. However, only one out of the five mutations is completely penetrant. A variable number of T-DNA copies has integrated in the mutant lines, although all segregate at one mutated locus. Two mutants could be defined as "early mutants": the mutated genes are presumably expressed during pollen grain maturation and their alteration leads to the production of nonfunctional pollen grains. Two other mutants could be defined as "late mutant" since their pollen is able to germinate but pollen tube growth is highly disturbed. Screening for segregation ratio distortions followed by thorough genetic analysis proved to be a powerful tool for identifying gametophytic mutations of all phases of pollen development.},

abstract = {Uptake and translocation of cationic nutrients play essential roles in physiological processes including plant growth, nutrition, signal transduction, and development. Approximately 5{\%} of the Arabidopsis genome appears to encode membrane transport proteins. These proteins are classified in 46 unique families containing approximately 880 members. In addition, several hundred putative transporters have not yet been assigned to families. In this paper, we have analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of over 150 cation transport proteins. This analysis has focused on cation transporter gene families for which initial characterizations have been achieved for individual members, including potassium transporters and channels, sodium transporters, calcium antiporters, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, cation diffusion facilitator proteins, natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins (NRAMP), and Zn-regulated transporter Fe-regulated transporter-like proteins. Phylogenetic trees of each family define the evolutionary relationships of the members to each other. These families contain numerous members, indicating diverse functions in vivo. Closely related isoforms and separate subfamilies exist within many of these gene families, indicating possible redundancies and specialized functions. To facilitate their further study, the PlantsT database (http://plantst.sdsc.edu) has been created that includes alignments of the analyzed cation transporters and their chromosomal locations.},

However, the mechanisms for Xist loading and spreading are currently unknown. Here, we define the nucleation center for Xist RNA and show that YY1 docks Xist particles onto the X chromosome. YY1 is a "bivalent" protein, capable of binding both RNA and DNA through different sequence motifs. Xist's exclusive attachment to the inactive X is determined by an epigenetically regulated trio of YY1 sites as well as allelic origin. Specific YY1-to-RNA and YY1-to-DNA contacts are required to load Xist particles onto X. YY1 interacts with Xist RNA through Repeat C. We propose that YY1 acts as adaptor between regulatory RNA and chromatin targets.},

The outward K(+) current (I(K+ out)) was similar in both protoplast types, while the inward K(+) current (I(K+ in)) was higher in pollen tube protoplasts. In PT but not in PG protoplasts, inward K(+) currents were already detectable at negative membrane voltages usually monitored in lily pollen. I(K+ in) consisted of a slow and a fast current component, as revealed by fitting a sum of two exponential functions to the time-dependent current. The contribution of the fast component to the total inward current was higher in PT than in PG protoplasts, which was even more evident at acidic pH of the external medium. Therefore, based on the measured characteristics, the I(K+ in) of PT protoplasts may contribute to the endogenous K(+) currents surrounding a growing pollen tube.},

abstract = {The permeation pore of K(+) channels is formed by four copies of the pore domain. AtKCO3 is the only putative voltage-independent K(+) channel subunit of Arabidopsis thaliana with a single pore domain. KCO3-like proteins recently emerged in evolution and, to date, have been found only in the genus Arabidopsis (A. thaliana and A. lyrata). We show that the absence of KCO3 does not cause marked changes in growth under various conditions. Only under osmotic stress we observed reduced root growth of the kco3-1 null-allele line. This phenotype was complemented by expressing a KCO3 mutant with an inactive pore, indicating that the function of KCO3 under osmotic stress does not depend on its direct ability to transport ions. Constitutively overexpressed AtKCO3 or AtKCO3::GFP are efficiently sorted to the tonoplast indicating that the protein is approved by the endoplasmic reticulum quality control. However, vacuoles isolated from transgenic plants do not have significant alterations in current density. Consistently, both AtKCO3 and AtKCO3::GFP are detected as homodimers upon velocity gradient centrifugation, an assembly state that would not allow for activity. We conclude that if AtKCO3 ever functions as a K(+) channel, active tetramers are held by particularly weak interactions, are formed only in unknown specific conditions and may require partner proteins.},

abstract = {Since anthocyanin accumulation would become insufficient if protected culture of the red leaf lettuce is carried out, the method for improving the quality of lettuce is required. Our previous study showed that the combined irradiation of blue light and UV-B at night resulted in notable promotion of anthocyanin synthesis. In this research, we investigated whether the blue light intensity of a light period would influence anthocyanin accumulation. When the blue light intensity of the light period was increased, anthocyanin accumulation was promoted, but it was restricted to a temporary effect. To the next, we investigated the anthocyanin accumulation of the red leaf lettuce under low photosynthesis photon flux density condition using red and blue LED. As a result, anthocyanin content was the highest in 100 mol m -2 s -1 blue light or simultaneous irradiation with 20 mol m -2 s -1 red and 80 mol m -2 s -1 blue light. The second was simultaneous irradiation with 50 mol m -2 s -1 red and 50 mol m -2 s -1 blue light, the 3rd was simultaneous irradiation with 80 mol m -2 s -1 red and 20 mol m -2 s -1 blue light, and 100 mol m -2 s -1 red light was the lowest. To clarify the molecular regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthesis by light quality, we isolated five anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, CHS, F3H, DFR, ANS and UFGT from the red-leaf lettuce. Gene expression analysis from treatment to 48 hours was conducted by the real-time PCR method. The expression of the genes which involve in anthocyanin biosynthesis were not able to be observed in 100 mol m -2 s -1 red light. On the other hand, in the case of 100 mol m -2 s -1 blue light and simultaneous irradiation with 50 mol m -2 s -1 red and 50 mol m -2 s -1 blue light, up to 24 hours after the light quality treatments, the enhanced expression of CHS, F3H, DFR, ANS, and UFGT were observed. Moreover, although the expression of F3H, DFR, and ANS were high level in simultaneous irradiation with 80 mol m -2 s -1 red and 20 mol m -2 s -1 blue light, the expression of CHS and UFGT was not so high. Therefore, it became clear to the biosynthetic mechanism of anthocyanin of red leaf lettuce that the ratio of red light and blue light is closely related.},

abstract = {In order to cope with reproduction in a dry environment without any sort of motility, plants have developed a very specialized and unique sexual system. Of special notice, the two sperm cells that will perform the double fertilization typical of higher plants are carried by one of the fastest growing cells in nature, the pollen tube. This tube develops from the vegetative cell of the pollen grain upon germination on the female tissues. While it cannot be considered as a canonical excitable cell, pollen tubes depend for most of their fundamental functional features on a close regulation of ion dynamics, namely in terms of polarization of extracellular fluxes and formation of standing cytosolic free ion gradients, namely of calcium (Ca(2+)) and protons (H(+)). In turn, these imply that plasma membrane transporters are polarized, or polarly regulated, and that internal signaling cascades transduce this spatial information into the basic features of growth and morphogenesis needed for pollen tubes to target correctly the ovules and discharge the sperm cells. Because of the singularity of this organization, and the ease with which pollen tubes can be experimentally handled, recent years have witnessed an accumulation of data at many levels, from basic biophysical and cell biology characterization, to gene assignment and transcriptomic description of pollen development. In this review we aim to organize this information in terms of the basic biophysical features of membrane function and integrate it into conceptual testable hypotheses on how the dynamics of ion regulation may underlie fundamental properties of cell development.},

Here the role of anthocyanins in tungsten sequestration was investigated using three species of Brassica : B. rapa (cv. Fast plants), B. juncea (Indian mustard) and B. oleracea (red cabbage). Seedlings of B. rapa and B. juncea turned blue when supplied with colourless tungstate. The blue compound co-localized with anthocyanins in the peripheral cell layers, and the degree of blueness was correlated with anthocyanin content. The direct involvement of anthocyanins in the blue coloration was evident when purified anthocyanins showed a colour change from pink to blue in vitro upon addition of tungstate, over a wide pH range. Anthocyanin production was upregulated 3-fold by W in B. juncea , possibly reflecting a function for anthocyanins in W tolerance or sequestration. The presence of anthocyanins facilitated W accumulation in B. rapa : anthocyanin-containing seedlings accumulated 3-fold more W than an anthocyaninless mutant. There was no correlation between anthocyanin content and W tolerance under these conditions. The nature of the interaction between anthocyanins and tungstate was investigated. X-ray absorption spectroscopy showed no change in the local chemical environment of W upon uptake of tungstate by the plant; HPLC analysis of purified anthocyanin with or without tungstate showed no peak shift after metal treatment.},

Thus, it is a complementary strategy that offers compelling scientific and applied advantages for strain development and process optimization, provided a desired phenotype is amenable to direct or indirect selection. In addition to simple empirical strain development by random mutation and direct selection on plates, evolutionary engineering also encompasses recombination and continuous evolution of large populations over many generations. Two distinct evolutionary engineering applications are likely to gain more relevance in the future: first, as an integral component in metabolic engineering of strains with improved phenotypes, and second, to elucidate the molecular basis of desired phenotypes for subsequent transfer to other hosts. The latter will profit from the broader availability of recently developed methodologies for global response analysis at the genetic and metabolic level. These methodologies facilitate identification of the molecular basis of evolved phenotypes. It is anticipated that, together with novel analytical techniques, bioinformatics, and computer modeling of cellular functions and activities, evolutionary engineering is likely to find its place in the metabolic engineer's toolbox for research and strain development. This review presents evolutionary engineering of whole cells as an emerging methodology that draws on the latest advances from a wide range of scientific and technical disciplines.},

abstract = {We have developed a vibrating calcium-specific electrode to measure minute extracellular calcium gradients and thus infer the patterns of calcium currents that cross the surface of various cells and tissues. Low-resistance calcium electrodes (routinely approximately 500 M omega) are vibrated by means of orthogonally stacked piezoelectrical pushers, driven by a damped square wave at an optimal frequency of 0.5 Hz. Phase-sensitive detection of the electrode signal is performed with either analogue or digital electronics. The resulting data are superimposed on a video image of the preparation that is being measured. Depending on the background calcium concentration, this new device can readily and reliably measure steady extracellular differences of calcium concentration which are as small as 0.01{\%} with spatial and temporal resolutions of a few microns and a few seconds, respectively. The digital version can attain a noise level of less than 1 microV. In exploratory studies, we have used this device to map and measure the patterns of calcium currents that cross the surface of growing fucoid eggs and tobacco pollen, moving amebae and Dictyostelium slugs, recently fertilized ascidian eggs, as well as nurse cells of Sarcophaga follicles. This approach should be easily extendable to other specific ion currents.},

abstract = {The 30S ribosomal subunit has two primary functions in protein synthesis. It discriminates against aminoacyl transfer RNAs that do not match the codon of messenger RNA, thereby ensuring accuracy in translation of the genetic message in a process called decoding. Also, it works with the 50S subunit to move the tRNAs and associated mRNA by precisely one codon, in a process called translocation. Here we describe the functional implications of the high-resolution 30S crystal structure presented in the accompanying paper, and infer details of the interactions between the 30S subunit and its tRNA and mRNA ligands. We also describe the crystal structure of the 30S subunit complexed with the antibiotics paromomycin, streptomycin and spectinomycin, which interfere with decoding and translocation. This work reveals the structural basis for the action of these antibiotics, and leads to a model for the role of the universally conserved 16S RNA residues A1492 and A1493 in the decoding process.},

We propose that a cis-regulatory element directs the stochastic expression of only one gene from a large array of linked receptor genes. Moreover, only one allelic array encoding multiple receptor genes is active in an individual neuron. We demonstrate that in a neuron expressing a given receptor, expression derives exclusively from one allele. In addition, we observe that alleles encoding the odorant receptors are replicated asynchronously, a phenomenon consistently associated with allelic inactivation. This model, involving inactivation of one allelic array and cis control of the active array, provides a mechanism such that individual neurons express one or a small number of receptors.},

abstract = {K(+) is an essential macronutrient required by plants to complete their life cycle. It fulfills important functions and it is widely used as a fertilizer to increase crop production. Thus, the identification of the systems involved in K(+) acquisition by plants has always been a research goal as it may eventually produce molecular tools to enhance crop productivity further. This review is focused on the recent findings on the systems involved in K(+) acquisition. From Epstein's pioneering work >40 years ago, K(+) uptake was considered to consist of a high- and a low-affinity component. The subsequent molecular approaches identified genes encoding K(+) transport systems which could be involved in the first step of K(+) uptake at the plant root. Insights into the regulation of these genes and the proteins that they encode have also been gained in recent studies. A demonstration of the role of the two main K(+) uptake systems at the root, AtHKA5 and AKT1, has been possible with the study of Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA insertion lines that knock out these genes. AtHAK5 was revealed as the only uptake system at external concentrations <10 $\mu$M. Between 10 and 200 $\mu$M both AtHAK5 and AKT1 contribute to K(+) acquisition. At external concentrations >500 $\mu$M, AtHAK5 is not relevant and AKT1's contribution to K(+) uptake becomes more important. At 10 mM K(+), unidentified systems may provide sufficient K(+) uptake for plant growth.},

abstract = {Heterochromatin, representing the silenced state of transcription, consists largely of transposon-enriched and highly repetitive sequences. Implicated in heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing in Drosophila are Piwi (P-element induced wimpy testis) and repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs). Despite this, the role of Piwi in rasiRNA expression and heterochromatic silencing remains unknown. Here we report the identification and characterization of 12,903 Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in Drosophila, showing that rasiRNAs represent a subset of piRNAs. We also show that Piwi promotes euchromatic histone modifications and piRNA transcription in subtelomeric heterochromatin (also known as telomere-associated sequence, or TAS), on the right arm of chromosome 3 (3R-TAS). Piwi binds to 3R-TAS and a piRNA uniquely mapped to 3R-TAS (3R-TAS1 piRNA). In piwi mutants, 3R-TAS loses euchromatic histone modifications yet accumulates heterochromatic histone modifications and Heterochromatin Protein 1a (HP1a). Furthermore, the expression of both the 3R-TAS1 piRNA and a white reporter gene in 3R-TAS becomes suppressed. A P element inserted 128 base pairs downstream of the 3R-TAS1 piRNA coding sequence restores the euchromatic histone modifications of 3R-TAS and the expression of 3R-TAS1 piRNA in piwi mutants, as well as partly rescuing their defects in germline stem-cell maintenance. These observations suggest that Piwi promotes the euchromatic character of 3R-TAS heterochromatin and its transcriptional activity, opposite to the known roles of Piwi and the RNA-mediated interference pathway in epigenetic silencing. This activating function is probably achieved through interaction with at least 3R-TAS1 piRNA and is essential for germline stem-cell maintenance.},

abstract = {Staying attached at a favorable site can be a major challenge for organisms in flow. Meeting this challenge depends on properties of the attachment structure and substrate, the nature of fluid flow, and the ability to adjust attachment force in response to hydrodynamic conditions. A broad taxonomic range of adult stages use adhesion or suction to attach to hard substrates in intertidal habitats, which experience flow from waves and tidal currents. We address the unique challenges of attachment to soft sediment in reproductive structures deposited on tidal flats. Egg masses of the opisthobranch mollusc Melanochlamys diomedea are anchored to the sediment by a buried tether composed of gel and sediment. In the field, populations differed in absolute tethering force and tethering force per unit size (= tenacity). Population differences in tenacity persisted for egg masses oviposited under common conditions in the laboratory. Adults exposed to greater flow produced tethers with greater tenacity but without an increase in tether size. Tethers tended to fail by slippage rather than breakage, indicating that tethering force depends more on frictional interaction with sediment than on strength of the tether axis. These results suggest that adults respond to variation in risks of embryo dislodgment by adjusting the tethering properties of egg masses, and that these adjustments involve more than simple changes in tether length or mass.},

Due to the absence of a Na(+)/K(+) exchanger, which widely exists in animal cells, K(+) channels and some type of K(+) transporters function as K(+) uptake systems in plants. Plant voltage-dependent K(+) channels, which display striking topological and functional similarities with the voltage-dependent six-transmembrane segment animal Shaker-type K(+) channels, have been found to play an important role in the plasma membrane of a variety of tissues and organs in higher plants. Outward-rectifying, inward-rectifying and weakly-rectifying K(+) channels have been identified and play a crucial role in K(+) homeostasis in plant cells. To adapt to the environmental conditions, plants must take advantage of the large variety of Shaker-type K(+) channels naturally present in the plant kingdom. This review summarizes the extensive data on the structure, function, membrane topogenesis, heteromerization, expression, localization, physiological roles and modulation of Shaker-type K(+) channels from various plant species. The accumulated results also help in understanding the similarities and differences in the properties of Shaker-type K(+) channels in plants in comparison to those of Shaker channels in animals and bacteria.},

PI 4,5-P2 is hydrolyzed by phospholipase C (PLC) activity to the signaling molecules inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacyl glycerol (DAG). To investigate PLC activity during tip growth, we cloned Nt PLC3, specifically expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) pollen tubes. Recombinant Nt PLC3 displayed Ca2+-dependent PI 4,5-P2-hydrolyzing activity sensitive to U-73122 and to mutations in the active site. Nt PLC3 overexpression, but not that of inactive mutants, inhibited pollen tube growth. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fused to Nt PLC3, or to its EF and C2 domains, accumulated laterally at the pollen tube tip plasma membrane in a pattern complementary to the distribution of PI 4,5-P2. The DAG marker Cys1:YFP displayed a similar intracellular localization as PI 4,5-P2. Blocking endocytic membrane recycling affected the intracellular distribution of DAG but not of PI 4,5-P2. U-73122 at low micromolar concentrations inhibited and partially depolarized pollen tube growth, caused PI 4,5-P2 spreading at the apex, and abolished DAG membrane accumulation. We show that Nt PLC3 is targeted by its EF and C2 domains to the plasma membrane laterally at the pollen tube tip and that it maintains, together with endocytic membrane recycling, an apical domain enriched in PI 4,5-P2 and DAG required for polar cell growth.},

abstract = {Assembly of plant Shaker subunits as heterotetramers, increasing channel functional diversity, has been reported. Here we focus on a new interaction, between AKT2 and KAT2 subunits. The assembly as AKT2/KAT2 heterotetramers is demonstrated by (i) a strong signal in two-hybrid tests with intracytoplasmic C-terminal regions, (ii) the effect of KAT2 on AKT2 subunit targeting in tobacco cells, (iii) the complete inhibition of AKT2 currents by co-expression with a dominant-negative KAT2 subunit in Xenopus oocytes, and reciprocally, and (iv) the appearance, upon co-expression of wild-type AKT2 and KAT2 subunits, of new channel functional properties that cannot be explained by the co-existence of two kinds of homotetrameric channels. In particular, the instantaneous current, characteristic of AKT2, displayed new functional features when compared with those of AKT2 homotetramers: activation by external acidification (instead of inhibition) and weak inhibition by calcium. Single channel current measurements in oocytes co-expressing AKT2 and KAT2 revealed a strong preference for incorporation of subunits into heteromultimers and a diversity of individual channels. In planta, these new channels, which may undergo specific regulations, are likely to be formed in guard cells and in the phloem, where they could participate in the control of membrane potential and potassium fluxes.},

More recently, biologic actions affecting inflammation, proteolysis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, metal chelation, ionophoresis, and bone metabolism have been researched. The therapeutic effects of tetracycline and its analogues in various diseases have also been investigated. These include rosacea, bullous dermatoses, neutrophilic diseases, pyoderma gangrenosum, sarcoidosis, aortic aneurysms, cancer metastasis, periodontitis, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma.

abstract = {Potassium is an important macronutrient and the most abundant cation in plants. Because soil mineral conditions can vary, plants must be able to adjust to different nutrient availabilities. Here, we used Affymetrix Genechip microarrays to identify genes responsive to potassium (K(+)) deprivation in roots of mature Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. Unexpectedly, only a few genes were changed in their expression level after 6, 48, and 96 h of K(+) starvation even though root K(+) content was reduced by approximately 60{\%}. AtHAK5, a potassium transporter gene from the KUP/HAK/KT family, was most consistently and strongly up-regulated in its expression level across 48-h, 96-h, and 7-d K(+) deprivation experiments. AtHAK5 promoter-beta-glucuronidase and -green fluorescent protein fusions showed AtHAK5 promoter activity in the epidermis and vasculature of K(+) deprived roots. Rb(+) uptake kinetics in roots of athak5 T-DNA insertion mutants and wild-type plants demonstrated the absence of a major part of an inducible high-affinity Rb(+)/K(+) (K(m) approximately 15-24 microm) transport system in athak5 plants. In comparative analyses, uptake kinetics of the K(+) channel mutant akt1-1 showed that akt1-1 roots are mainly impaired in a major transport mechanism, with an apparent affinity of approximately 0.9 mm K(+)(Rb(+)). Data show adaptation of apparent K(+) affinities of Arabidopsis roots when individual K(+) transporter genes are disrupted. In addition, the limited transcriptome-wide response to K(+) starvation indicates that posttranscriptional mechanisms may play important roles in root adaptation to K(+) availability in Arabidopsis. The results demonstrate an in vivo function for AtHAK5 in the inducible high-affinity K(+) uptake system in Arabidopsis roots.},

abstract = {Anthocyanins were extracted from a mixture of berries of Vaccinium angustifolium and Vaccinium myrtilloides at 7.7 degrees C, 26 degrees C, and 79 degrees C using ethanol alone or ethanol acidified with hydrochloric, citric, tartaric, lactic, or phosphoric acids at a solvent to solid ratio of 10. The effect of these parameters on extracted anthocyanins stability was investigated. The pH-differential and HPLC-DAD methods were used to determine anthocyanin contents. Extracted anthocyanins were purified on a C-18 solid-phase extraction cartridge and characterized by HPLC/electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Anthocyanins were identified according to their HPLC retention times, elution order, and MS fragmentation pattern and by comparison with standards and published data. Anthocyanin extractions gave different yields depending on the type of added acid and the extraction temperature. High yields of monomeric and total anthocyanins (26.3 and 28.9 mg/g of dry matter) were obtained at 79 degrees C using phosphoric acid. Extraction using tartaric acid at 79 degrees C provided the lowest degradation index (1.05). Anthocyanins were stable and browning by polyphenol oxidase was inhibited under these conditions. Of the six common anthocyanindins, five were identified in the extracts, namely, delpinidin, cyanidin, peonidin, petunidin, and malvidin; pelargonidin was not found. In addition to well-known major anthocyanins, new anthocyanins were identified for the first time in extracts of wild blueberries from Quebec.},

abstract = {Niche differentiation has been proposed as an explanation for rarity in species assemblages. To test this hypothesis requires quantifying the ecological similarity of species. This similarity can potentially be estimated by using phylogenetic relatedness. In this study, we predicted that if niche differentiation does explain the co-occurrence of rare and common species, then rare species should contribute greatly to the overall community phylogenetic diversity (PD), abundance will have phylogenetic signal, and common and rare species will be phylogenetically dissimilar. We tested these predictions by developing a novel method that integrates species rank abundance distributions with phylogenetic trees and trend analyses, to examine the relative contribution of individual species to the overall community PD. We then supplement this approach with analyses of phylogenetic signal in abundances and measures of phylogenetic similarity within and between rare and common species groups. We applied this analytical approach to 15 long-term temperate and tropical forest dynamics plots from around the world. We show that the niche differentiation hypothesis is supported in six of the nine gap-dominated forests but is rejected in the six disturbance-dominated and three gap-dominated forests. We also show that the three metrics utilized in this study each provide unique but corroborating information regarding the phylogenetic distribution of rarity in communities.},

abstract = {We have used Arabidopsis calmodulin (CaM) covalently coupled to horseradish peroxidase to screen a barley aleurone cDNA expression library for CaM binding proteins. The deduced amino acid sequence of one cDNA obtained by this screen was shown to be a unique protein of 702 amino acids with CaM and cyclic nucleotide binding domains at the carboxyl terminus and high similarity to olfactory and K+ channels. This cDNA was designated HvCBT1 (Hordeum vulgare CaM binding transporter). Hydropathy plots of HvCBT1 showed the presence of six putative transmembrane domains, but sequence alignment indicated a pore domain that was unlike the consensus domains in K+ and olfactory channels. Expression of a subclone of amino acids 482-702 in Escherichia coli generated a peptide that bound CaM. When a fusion protein of HvCBT1 and green fluorescent protein was expressed in barley aleurone protoplasts, fluorescence accumulated in the plasma membrane. Expression of HvCBT1 in the K+ transport deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant CY162 showed no rescue of the mutant phenotype. However, growth of CY162 expressing HvCBT1 with its pore mutated to GYGD, the consensus sequence of K+ channels, was compromised. We interpret these data as indicating that HvCBT1 acts to interfere with ion transport.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pollen is the male gametophyte of higher plants. Upon pollination, it germinates and develops into a fast-growing cytoplasmic extension, the pollen tube, which ultimately delivers the sperm into the ovary. The biological relevance of its role, and the uniqueness of this kind of cellular organization, have made pollen the focus of many approaches, and it stands today as one of the best-known models in plant cell biology. In contrast, the genetic background of its development has been until recently largely unknown. Some genes involved have been described and a few functional mutants have been characterized, but only to a limited extent and allowing only a limited understanding of the regulatory mechanisms. Yet, being a relatively simple organ (2 or 3 cells), pollen stands as an excellent target for molecular-biology-based approaches. RECENT PROGRESS: Recent studies on Arabidopsis thaliana have characterized the transcriptional profile of pollen grains and microgametogenesis in comparison to sporophytic tissues. They underline the unique characteristics of pollen, not only in terms of a strongly reduced set of genes being expressed, but also in terms of the functions of the proteins encoded and the pathways they are involved in. These approaches have expanded the number of genes with known expression in pollen from a few hundred to nearly eight thousand. While for the first time allowing systems and/or gene-family approaches, this information also expands dramatically the possibility of hypothesis-driven experimentation based on specific gene function predictions. Recent studies reveal this to be the case in, for example, transcriptional regulation, cell-cycle progression and gene-silencing mechanisms in mature pollen.},

abstract = {Among the highly conserved sites in K+ channel pores, the tyrosine-glycine sequence is believed to play an important role in selectivity. Here we describe a novel approach in which comprehensive mutagenesis of the YG sites of the voltage-gated K+ channel, Kat1, is combined with phenotypic screening in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and electrophysiological analysis in Xenopus oocytes to determine the roles of these sites in K+ selectivity. We show that structural constraints necessitate a tyrosine or phenylalanine at the first position to confer full K+ selectivity. Substitution to arginine creates a channel titratable by external pH, suggesting that the side group at this position may line the channel pore. Permeation is abolished by any increase in bulk at the adjacent glycine position unless accompanied by a compensatory mutation at the tyrosine site. These results suggest a model in which the selectivity filter of the K+ channel requires an aromatic residue paired with glycine within the pore loop in order to maintain maximal K+ selectivity.},

abstract = {Tissue ferritins from the horse, rat, and human consist of multiple isoferritins some of which are common to more than one tissue in the same individual. Subunit analyses indicate that the ferritins from all three species are similarly composed of only two types of subunit with an approximate Mr of 21,000 and 19,000, designated H and L. The relative amounts of these subunits vary progressively throughout the isoferritin spectrum. Amino acid analyses and tryptic peptide maps indicate that the H and L subunits have extensive sequence homologies and that both are species-specific. Both subunits have been identified as the primary products of apoferritin synthesis in a wheat germ lysate programmed by rat liver mRNA. These results substantiate our proposal (Adelman, T. G., Arosio, P., and Drysdale, J. W. (1975) Biochem. Biophys. Res.

abstract = {Ratio images of cytosolic Ca2+ (Ca2+i) in growing, fura-2-dextran-loaded Lilium longiflorum pollen tubes taken at 3- to 5-sec intervals showed that the tip-focused [Ca2+]i gradient oscillates with the same period as growth. Similarly, measurement of the extracellular inward current, using a noninvasive ion-selective vibrating probe, indicated that the tip-directed extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+o) current also oscillates with the same period as growth. Cross-correlation analysis revealed that whereas the [Ca2+]i gradient oscillates in phase with growth, the influx of Ca2+o lags by {\~{}}11 sec. Ion influx thus appears to follow growth, with the effect that the rate of growth at a given point determines the magnitude of the ion influx {\~{}}11 sec later. To explain the phase delay in the extracellular inward current, there must be a storage of Ca2+ for which we consider two possibilities: either the inward current represents the refilling of intracellular stores (capacitative calcium entry), or it represents the binding of the ion within the cell wall domain.},

abstract = {The transformations George Williams initiated in evolutionary biology seem so blindingly obvious in retrospect that they spur the question of why he saw what no one else did. While most humans are prone to see only what theory predicts, Williams sees in bold relief whatever does not fit. Not an adaptationist or an anti-adaptationist, Williams is better described as a maladaptionist. The challenge of finding evolutionary explanations for apparent maladaptations has been overlooked with casualness akin to that once typical for group selection. Suboptimal traits tend to be dismissed as illustrations of the weakness and stochastic nature of selection compared with mutation and drift. A closer look suggests that such constraints are only one of six possible kinds of explanations for apparently suboptimal designs: mismatch, coevolution, tradeoffs, constraints, reproductive advantage at the expense of the individual, and defenses that are aversive but useful. Medicine has asked proximate questions at every possible level but has only, begun to ash evolutionary questions about why bodies are vulnerable to disease. Considering all six possible evolutionary reasons for apparently suboptimal traits will spur progress not only in medicine but also more generally in biology. "Williams Vision" may not yield a net benefit to the possessor but it is invaluable for the species.},

abstract = {We describe a model-based clustering method for using multilocus genotype data to infer population structure and assign individuals to populations. We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

KAT1 was cloned by its ability to suppress a K+ transport-defective phenotype in mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. This suppression is sensitive to known K+ channel blockers, including tetraethylammonium and Ba2+ ions. The KAT1 cDNA contains an open reading frame capable of encoding a 78-kDa protein that shares structural features found in the Shaker superfamily of K+ channels. These include a cluster of six putative membrane-spanning helices (S1-S6) at the amino terminus of the protein, a presumed voltage-sensing region containing Arg/Lys-Xaa-Xaa-Arg/Lys repeats within S4, and the highly conserved pore-forming region (known as H5 or SS1-SS2). Our results suggest that the structural motif for K+ channels has been conserved between plants and animals.},

They show a high degree of similarity to Shaker-type voltage-gated channels and contain a C-terminal cyclic nucleotide-binding domain with an overlapping calmodulin-binding domain. Heterologously expressed plant CNGCs show activation by cyclic nucleotides and permeability to monovalent and divalent cations. In plants, downstream effectors of cyclic nucleotide signals have so far remained obscure, and CNGCs might be their prime targets. The unique position of CNGCs as ligand-gated Ca2+-permeable channels suggests that they function at key sites where cyclic nucleotide and Ca2+ signalling pathways interact. Such processes include plant defence responses, and two recently characterized Arabidopsis mutants in CNGC genes indeed show altered pathogen responses.},

abstract = {Transient kinetics of net H+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl- fluxes were measured non-invasively, using an ion-selective microelectrode technique, for bean (Vicia faba L.) leaf mesophyll in response to 150 mM mannitol treatment. In a parallel set of experiments, changes in the plasma membrane potential and the total proline content in leaves were monitored. Regardless of the ionic composition of the bath solution, hyperosmotic stress caused a significant increase in the K+ and Cl- uptake into mesophyll cells. At the same time, no significant proline changes were observed for at least 16 h after the onset of stress. Experiments with inhibitors suggested that potassium inward rectifier (KIR) channels, exhibiting mechanosensitive properties and acting as primary receptors of osmotic stress, are likely to be involved. Due to the coupling by membrane potential, changes in K+ and Cl- transport may modify activity of the plasma membrane H+-pump. Such coupling may also be responsible for the mannitol-induced oscillations (period of about 4 min) in net ion fluxes observed in 90{\%} of plants. Calculations show that influx of K+ and Cl- observed in response to hyperosmotic treatment may provide an adequate osmotic adjustment in bean mesophyll, which suggests that the activity of the plasma membrane transporters for these ions should be targeted to improve osmotolerance, at least in this crop.},

Our experiments showed strong tight induction of the MYB genes PAPI and PAP2. In particular, the kinetics of PAP1 expression preceded those of PAP2 and all. of the structural genes (CHS, DFR, F3H, LDOX), consistent with the hypothesis that it has a key role in Light induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis. All bHLH genes analysed showed tight induction, and in seedlings their expression preceded that of the late structural genes, suggesting their possible rote in light regulation of these structural genes. TFG1 expression is essentially constitutive in both systems. Experiments with transgenic tines over-expressing the MYB factors show that PAP1, but not PAP2, strongly stimulates expression of the anthocyanin structural gene encoding dihydroflavonol reductase, but neither factor affected expression of the early flavonoid biosynthesis gene encoding chalcone synthase. Consistent with these findings, PAP1, but not PAP2, stimulated tight induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in seedlings. We conclude that specific members of the MYB and bHLH families play important rotes in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in response to different light qualities in Arabidopsis.

The AtCHX23 protein is localized in the chloroplast envelope. Plastids from chx23 mutants had straight thylakoids but lacked grana lamellae. chx23 mutant leaves were pale yellow and had a much reduced chlorophyll content. The chlorophyll content of chx23 was increased by growing in medium at low (4.0) pH and decreased by growing at high (7.0) pH. The cytosolic pH in the leaves of the mutant was significantly higher than that in the wild type. chx23 mutants displayed a high sensitivity to NaCl. Together, these data indicate that CHX23 is a probable chloroplast Na(+)(K(+))/H(+) exchanger important for pH homeostasis and chloroplast development and function.},

In this study, we characterize a K+ transporter that functions in both high- and low-affinity uptake. Using yeast complementation analysis, we isolated a cDNA for a functional K+ transporter from Arabidopsis (referred to as AtKUP1 for Arabidopsis thaliana K+ uptake). When expressed in a yeast mutant, AtKUP1 dramatically increased K+ uptake capacity at both a low and high [K+] range. Kinetic analyses showed that AtKUP1-mediated K+ uptake displays a "biphasic" pattern similar to that observed in plant roots. The transition from the high-affinity phase (K(m) of 44 microM) to the low-affinity phase (K(m) of 11 mM) occurred at 100 to 200 microM external K+. Both low- and high-affinity K+ uptake via AtKUP1 were inhibited by 5 mM or higher concentrations of NaCl. In addition, AtKUP1-mediated K+ uptake was inhibited by K+ channel blockers, including tetraethylammonium, Cs+, and Ba2+. Consistent with a possible function in K+ uptake from the soil, the AtKUP1 gene is primarily expressed in roots. We conclude that the AtKUP1 gene product may function as a K+ transporter in Arabidopsis roots over a broad range of [K+] in the soil.},

These modifications affect early growth and development through their influence on gene expression especially on imprinted genes. Genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells is essential in order to reset the parent-of-origin specific marking of imprinted genes, but may have a more general role in the restoration of totipotency in the early embryo. In a similar way, on somatic nuclear cloning, a differentiated cell must become 'reprogrammed' restoring totipotency in order to undergo development. Here we discuss the dynamic epigenetic reprogramming that takes place during normal development and highlight those areas with relevance to somatic nuclear cloning and the possibility of improving the efficiency of this process. We propose the concept of 'epigenetic checkpoints' for normal progression of development and the loss of totipotency. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ion signals are critical to regulating polarized growth in many cell types, including pollen in plants and neurons in animals. Genetic evidence presented here indicates that pollen tube growth requires cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGC) 18. CNGCs are nonspecific cation channels found in plants and animals and have well established functions in excitatory signal transduction events in animals. In Arabidopsis, male sterility was observed for two cngc18 null mutations. CNGC18 is expressed primarily in pollen, as indicated from a promoter::GUS (beta-glucuronidase) reporter analysis and expression profiling. The underlying cause of sterility was identified as a defect in pollen tube growth, resulting in tubes that were kinky, short, often thin, and unable to grow into the transmitting tract. Expression of a GFP-tagged CNGC18 in mutant pollen provided complementation and evidence for asymmetric localization of CNGC18 to the plasma membrane at the growing tip, starting at the time of pollen grain germination. Heterologous expression of CNGC18 in Escherichia coli resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent accumulation of more Ca2+. Thus, CNGC18 provides a mechanism to directly transduce a cyclic nucleotide (cNMP) signal into an ion flux that can produce a localized signal capable of regulating the pollen tip-growth machinery. These results identify a CNGC that is essential to an organism's life cycle and raise the possibility that CNGCs have a widespread role in regulating cell-growth dynamics in both plant and animals.},

In this study, a green fluorescent protein- collagen fusion has been constructed by using the Caenorhabditis elegans adult-specific, hypodermally synthesized collagen COL-19. In wild-type nematodes, this collagen marker localized to the circumferential annular rings and the lateral trilaminar alae of the cuticle. Crosses carried out between a COL-19::GFP integrated strain and several morphologically mutant strains, including blister, dumpy, long, small, squat, and roller revealed significant COL-19 disruption that was predominantly strain-specific and provided a structural basis for the associated phenotypes. Disruption was most notable in the cuticle overlying the lateral seam cell syncytium, and confirmed the presence of two distinct forms of hypodermis, namely the circumferentially contracting lateral seam cells and the laterally contracting ventral-dorsal hypodermis. The effect of a single aberrant collagen being sufficient to mediate widespread collagen disruption was exemplified by the collagen mutant strain dpy-5 and its disrupted COL-19::GFP and DPY-7 collagen expression patterns. Through the disrupted pattern of COL-19 and DPY-7 in a thioredoxin mutant, dpy-11, and through RNA interference of a dual oxidase enzyme and a vesicular transport protein, we also show the efficacy of the COL-19::GFP strain as a marker for aberrant cuticle collagen synthesis and, thus, for the identification of factors involved in the construction of collagenous extracellular matrices.

In type A cells, IFNs mainly inhibited virus particle release, whereas in type B cells, the anti-HIV effect of IFNs cells was found to be largely due to a specific inhibition of viral protein synthesis without any apparent effect on total cellular protein synthesis. Interestingly, such a differential inhibition of HIV protein synthesis could also be demonstrated in acutely infected CEM cells in response to treatment with IFN-a. Both in chronically infected U937 type B and acutely infected CEM cells, equivalent amounts of nuclear and cytoplasmic HIV-1 mRNA were detected in control and IFN-treated cells in spite of at least 80{\%} inhibition of HIV protein synthesis. Analysis of the distribution of cellular and viral mRNAs on polysomes in HIV-1-infected cells demonstrated that IFN treatment induces a specific block on viral mRNA translation. These results indicate that the antiviral mechanism of IFN on later stages of HIV replication cycle may be partly due to the inhibition of HIV mRNA translation, besides an effect on virus budding or release.},

abstract = {Potassium (K+) channels play multiple roles in higher plants, and have been characterized electrophysiologically in various subcellular membranes. The K+ channel AtKCO1 from Arabidopsis thaliana is the prototype of a new family of plant K+ channels. In a previous study the protein has been functionally characterized after heterologous expression in Baculovirus-infected insect cells. In order to obtain further information on the physiological function of AtKCO1, the gene expression pattern and subcellular localization of the protein in plants were investigated. The regulatory function of the 5' region of the AtKCO1 gene was examined in transgenic A. thaliana plants carrying beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion constructs. Our analysis demonstrates that the AtKCO1 promoter is active in various tissues and cell types, and the highest GUS activity could be detected in mitotically active tissues of the plant. Promoter activity was strongly dependent on the presence of a 5' leader intron. The same overall structure was identified in two genes encoding AtKCO1-like K+ channels from Solanum tuberosum (StKCO1alpha and StKCO1beta). To investigate the subcellular localization of AtKCO1, the channel protein, as well as a fusion protein of AtKCO1 with green fluorescence protein (GFP), were expressed in transgenic tobacco BY2 cells. In sucrose density gradients, both proteins co-fractionate with tonoplast markers (Nt-TIPa, vATPase). In fluorescence images from transgenic AtKCO1-GFP BY2 cells fluorescence was exclusively detected in the tonoplast. Thus AtKCO1 is the first cloned K+ channel demonstrated to be a vacuolar K+ channel.},

Nature has evolved a collection of small molecule agents, including the shellfish poison (+)-saxitoxin, that bind to the extracellular pore of select Na(V) isoforms. As described in this report, de novo chemical synthesis has enabled the preparation of fluorescently labeled derivatives of (+)-saxitoxin, STX-Cy5, and STX-DCDHF, which display reversible binding to Na(V)s in live cells. Electrophysiology and confocal fluorescence microscopy studies confirm that these STX-based dyes function as potent and selective Na(V) labels. The utility of these probes is underscored in single-molecule and super-resolution imaging experiments, which reveal Na(V) distributions well beyond the optical diffraction limit in subcellular features such as neuritic spines and filopodia.},

The six Arabidopsis thaliana intracellular NHX members are divided into two groups, endosomal (NHX5 and NHX6) and vacuolar (NHX1 to NHX4). Of the vacuolar members, NHX1 has been characterized functionally, but the remaining members have largely unknown roles. Using reverse genetics, we show that, unlike the single knockouts nhx1 or nhx2, the double knockout nhx1 nhx2 had significantly reduced growth, smaller cells, shorter hypocotyls in etiolated seedlings and abnormal stamens in mature flowers. Filaments of nhx1 nhx2 did not elongate and lacked the ability to dehisce and release pollen, resulting in a near lack of silique formation. Pollen viability and germination was not affected. Quantification of vacuolar pH and intravacuolar K(+) concentrations indicated that nhx1 nhx2 vacuoles were more acidic and accumulated only 30{\%} of the wild-type K(+) concentration, highlighting the roles of NHX1 and NHX2 in mediating vacuolar K(+)/H(+) exchange. Growth under added Na(+), but not K(+), partly rescued the flower and growth phenotypes. Our results demonstrate the roles of NHX1 and NHX2 in regulating intravacuolar K(+) and pH, which are essential to cell expansion and flower development.},

Many of these pathways may use common intracellular second messengers, with ions and reactive oxygen species emerging as two major common denominators in many of the processes involved in tip growth. These second messengers might influence the actin cytoskeleton through known interactions with actin-binding proteins. In turn, changes in the dynamic properties of the cytoskeleton would define the basic polarity events needed to shape and modify tip-growing cells.},

abstract = {The 5′ terminal sequences of several adenovirus 2 (Ad2) mRNAs, isolated late in infection, are complementary to sequences within the Ad2 genome which are remote from the DNA from which the main coding sequence of each mRNA is transcribed. This has been observed by forming RNA displacement loops (R loops) between Ad2 DNA and unfractionated polysomal RNA from infected cells. The 5′ terminal sequences of mRNAs in R loops, variously located between positions 36 and 92, form complex secondary hybrids with single-stranded DNA from restriction endonuclease fragments containing sequences to the left of position 36 on the Ad2 genome. The structures visualized in the electron microscope show that short sequences coded at map positions 16.6, 19.6 and 26.6 on the R strand are joined to form a leader sequence of 150–200 nucleotides at the 5′ end of many late mRNAs. A late mRNA which maps to the left of position 16.6 shows a different pattern of second site hybridization. It contains sequences from 4.9−6.0 linked directly to those from 9.6−10.9. These findings imply a new mechanism for the biosynthesis of Ad2 mRNA in mammalian cells.},

abstract = {The molecular mechanisms by which higher plant cells take up K+ across the plasma membrane (plasmalemma) remain unknown. Physiological transport studies in a large number of higher plant cell types, including guard cells, have suggested that at least two distinct types of K(+)-uptake mechanisms exist, permitting low-affinity and high-affinity K+ accumulation, respectively. Recent patch clamp studies have revealed the presence of inward-conducting (inward-rectifying) K+ channels in the plasma membrane of higher plant cells. Research on guard cells has suggested that these K+ channels provide a major pathway for proton pump-driven K+ uptake during stomatal opening. In the present study the contribution of inward-rectifying K+ channels to higher plant cell K+ uptake was investigated by examining kinetic properties of guard cell K+ channels in Vicia faba in response to changes in the extracellular K+ concentration. Increasing the extracellular K+ concentration in the range from 0.3 mM to 11.25 mM led to enhancement of inward K+ currents and changes in current-voltage characteristics of K+ channels. The increase in K+ conductance as a function of the extracellular K+ concentration revealed a K(+)-equilibrium dissociation constant (Km) of approximately 3.5 mM, which suggests that inward-rectifying K+ channels can function as a molecular mechanism for low-affinity K+ uptake. Lowering the extracellular K+ concentration in the range from 11 mM to 1 mM induced negative shifts in the activation potential of K+ channels, such that these channels function as a K+ sensor, permitting only K+ uptake. At low extracellular K+ concentrations of 0.3 mM K+, inward-rectifying K+ channels induce hyperpolarization. Results from the present study suggest that inward-rectifying K+ channels constitute an essential molecular mechanism for plant nutrition and growth control by providing a K(+)-sensing and voltage-dependent pathway for low-affinity K+ uptake into higher plant cells and additionally by contributing to plasma membrane potential regulation.},

Adh-psi was hypothesized to be a pseudogene derived from an Adh duplication in the repleta group of Drosophila; however, several results from molecular analyses of this gene conflict with currently held notions of molecular evolution. Perhaps the most difficult observations to reconcile with the pseudogene hypothesis are that the hypothetical replacement sites of Adh-psi evolve only slightly more quickly than replacement sites of closely related, functional Adh genes, and that the replacement sites of the pseudogenes evolve considerably more slowly than neighboring silent sites. The data have been presented as a paradox that challenges our understanding of the mechanisms underlying DNA sequence divergence. Here I show that Adh-psi is actually a new, functional gene recently descended from an Adh duplication. This descendant recruited similar to 60 new N-terminal amino acids, is considerably more basic than ADH, and is evolving at a faster rate than Adh. Furthermore, though the descendant is clearly functional, as inferred from molecular evolution and population genetic data, it retains no obvious ADH activity. This probably reflects functional divergence from its Adh ancestor.},

abstract = {The Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA, KAT1, encodes a hyperpolarization-activated K+ channel. In the present study, we utilized a combination of random site-directed mutagenesis, genetic screening in a potassium uptake-deficient yeast strain, and electrophysiological analysis in Xenopus oocytes to identify strong modifications in cation selectivity of the inward rectifying K+ channel KAT1. Threonine at position 256 was replaced by 11 other amino acid residues. Six of these mutated KAT1 cDNAs complemented a K+ uptake-deficient yeast strain at low concentrations of potassium. Among these, two mutants (T256D and T256G) showed a sensitivity of yeast growth toward high ammonium concentrations and a dramatic increase in current amplitudes of rubidium and ammonium ions relative to K+ by 39-72-fold. These single site mutations gave rise to Rb+- and NH4(+)-selective channels with Rb+ and NH4+ currents that were approximately 10-13-fold greater in amplitude than K+ currents, whereas the NH4+ to K+ current amplitude ratio of wild type KAT1 was 0.28. This strong conversion in cation specificity without loss of general selectivity exceeds those reported for other mutations in the pore domain of voltage-dependent K+ channels. Yeast growth was greatly impaired by sodium in two other mutants at this site (T256E and T256Q), which were blocked by millimolar sodium (K1/2 = 1.1 mM for T256E), although the wild type channel was not blocked by 110 mM sodium. Interestingly, the ability of yeast to grow in the presence of toxic cations correlated to biophysical properties of KAT1 mutants, illustrating the potential for qualitative K+ channel mutant selection in yeast. These data suggest that the size of the side chain of the amino acid at position 256 in KAT1 is important for enabling cation permeation and that this site plays a crucial role in determining the cation selectivity of hyperpolarization-activated potassium channels.},

Since most of the nucleotide variations (93{\%}) were singleton and doubleton, Tajima's test statistic was significantly negative. About 50{\%} of nucleotide polymorphisms in exons were replacement, which caused significance in McDonald and Kreitman's test when compared with Arabis gemmifera and Cardaminopsis petraea. These results indicated that DNA polymorphism at the PgiC locus was not under neutrality. There were two divergent sequence types in the PgiC region, which were associated with allozyme variation. The Fast allozyme was shown to have originated from the Slow allozyme, since two outgroup species had the Slow form. A phylogenetic tree of ecotypes with the Fast allozyme had the shape of a star phylogeny. Mismatch distribution of the Fast allozyme ecotypes resembled that expected under an expanding population model.

abstract = {PETAL LOSS is a new class of flower development gene whose mutant phenotype is confined mostly to the second whorl, Two properties are disrupted, organ initiation and organ orientation. Initiation is frequently blocked, especially in later-formed flowers, or variably delayed. The few petals that arise occupy a wider zone of the flower primordium than normal. Also, a minority of petals are trumpet-shaped, thread-like or stamenoid. Studies of ptl combined with homeotic mutants have revealed that the mutant effect is specific to the second whorl. not to organs with a petal identity. We propose that the PTL gene normally promotes the induction of organ primordia in specific regions of the second floral whorl, In prl mutants, these regions are enlarged and organ induction is variably reduced, often falling below a threshold. A dominant genetic modifier of the ptl mutant phenotype was found in the Landsberg erecta strain that significantly boosts the mean number of petals per flower, perhaps by reinforcing induction so that the threshold is now more often reached, The second major disruption in prl mutants relates to the orientation adopted by second whorl organs from early in their development. In single mutants the full range of orientations is seen, but when B function (controlling organ identity) is also removed, most second whorl organs now face outwards rather than inwards. Orientation is unaffected in B function single mutants. Thus petals apparently perceive their orientation within the flower primordium by a mechanism requiring PTL function supported redundantly by that of B class genes.},

In this review, we summarize K(+) signaling processes and K(+) transport regulation in higher plants, especially in plant responses to K(+)-deficiency stress. Plants perceive external K(+) fluctuations and generate the initial K(+) signal in root cells. This signal is transduced into the cytoplasm and encoded as Ca(2+) and reactive oxygen species signaling. K(+)-deficiency-induced signals are subsequently decoded by cytoplasmic sensors, which regulate the downstream transcriptional and posttranslational responses. Eventually, plants produce a series of adaptive events in both physiological and morphological alterations that help them survive K(+) deficiency.},

abstract = {A few membrane vesicle trafficking (SNARE) proteins in plants are associated with signaling and transmembrane ion transport, including control of plasma membrane ion channels. Vesicle traffic contributes to the population of ion channels at the plasma membrane. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether these SNAREs also interact directly to affect channel gating and, if so, what functional impact this might have on the plant. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis thaliana SNARE SYP121 binds to KC1, a regulatory K(+) channel subunit that assembles with different inward-rectifying K(+) channels to affect their activities. We demonstrate that SYP121 interacts preferentially with KC1 over other Kv-like K(+) channel subunits and that KC1 interacts specifically with SYP121 but not with its closest structural and functional homolog SYP122 nor with another related SNARE SYP111. SYP121 promoted gating of the inward-rectifying K(+) channel AKT1 but only when heterologously coexpressed with KC1. Mutation in any one of the three genes, SYP121, KC1, and AKT1, selectively suppressed the inward-rectifying K(+) current in Arabidopsis root epidermal protoplasts as well as K(+) acquisition and growth in seedlings when channel-mediated K(+) uptake was limiting. That SYP121 should be important for gating of a K(+) channel and its role in inorganic mineral nutrition demonstrates an unexpected role for SNARE-ion channel interactions, apparently divorced from signaling and vesicle traffic. Instead, it suggests a role in regulating K(+) uptake coordinately with membrane expansion for cell growth.},

abstract = {Many patterns of distribution and abundance of intertidal animals are explained by processes of movements of animals, selecting particular habitats or levels on the shore, or interacting with other species. Movements of intertidal animals have therefore been studied over many years. During this long history, much intertidal ecology has changed in focus from broad-scale to small-scale patterns and processes, although there has been recent refocus on a combination of many scales. Simultaneously, there has been an increase in the incidence of field experiments and growing recognition that behaviour is more flexible than originally thought. This review examines changes in the ways that experiments on movements on intertidal animals have been and are being done, taking into account these changes in emphasis. Although some progress has been made, there is still a long way to go. The idea is still prevalent that behaviour is simple, rather invariant and that the animals respond to broad-scale cues that have traditionally been of interest to many investigators. This means that many experiments are still designed to minimise (or ignore) natural variation in behaviour rather than to measure it and that any associated disturbances are considered irrelevant and therefore not evaluated. Understanding the role that behaviour has in establishing and maintaining many of the patterns observed on intertidal shores is crucial to our understanding of the ecology of these habitats. Better experiments, designed logically with appropriate controls to evaluate realistic processes and to measure how behaviour varies among places and from time to time can only improve this understanding.

abstract = {Over 3,000 human diseases are known to be linked to heritable genetic variation, mapping to over 1,700 unique genes. Dating of the evolutionary age of these disease-associated genes has suggested that they have a tendency to be ancient, specifically coming into existence with early metazoa. The approach taken by past studies, however, assumes that the age of a disease is the same as the age of its common ancestor, ignoring the fundamental contribution of duplication events in the evolution of new genes and function. Here, we date both the common ancestor and the duplication history of known human disease-associated genes. We find that the majority of disease genes (80{\%}) are genes that have been duplicated in their evolutionary history. Periods for which there are more disease-associated genes, for example, at the origins of bony vertebrates, are explained by the emergence of more genes at that time, and the majority of these are duplicates inferred to have arisen by whole-genome duplication. These relationships are similar for different disease types and the disease-associated gene's cellular function. This indicates that the emergence of duplication-associated diseases has been ongoing and approximately constant (relative to the retention of duplicate genes) throughout the evolution of life. This continued until approximately 390 Ma from which time relatively fewer novel genes came into existence on the human lineage, let alone disease genes. For single-copy genes associated with disease, we find that the numbers of disease genes decreases with recency. For the majority of duplicates, the disease-associated mutation is associated with just one of the duplicate copies. A universal explanation for heritable disease is, thus, that it is merely a by-product of the evolutionary process; the evolution of new genes (de novo or by duplication) results in the potential for new diseases to emerge.},

abstract = {By the end of the 21st century models of climate change predict that the air temperature over most of the British Isles will increase by between 2 and 3 °C and sea-level will rise by 40–50 cm. Over that period it will become windier and mean wave height will increase, as will the frequency of storms. These changes in climate and weather will impact the intertidal zone of the UK and will cause distribution changes in many of the common invertebrate species that live there. Where these changes are severe they may well impact on patterns of distribution of ducks and wading birds. In the British Isles a number of organisms live close to their geographical limits of distribution. Some of these species might be expected to extend their range as climatic restraints are relaxed. Species currently limited by cool summers or winter cold will move northwards. In most cases the effects on the distribution of waterbirds will be small. For example, the replacement of the Northern Limpet Patella vulgata by the Southern Limpet P. depressa is unlikely to adversely affect Eurasian Oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus. Of wider concern is the possibility that as climate warms the abundance and productivity of brown algae will decrease. This is likely to have two significant effects for waders. First, it would represent a loss of potentially rich feeding grounds for species such as Ruddy Turnstone Arenaria interpres that feed on small easily desiccated invertebrates living on or below the seaweed. Secondly, as algae die or are broken away the resulting debris is exported to sediment habitats where it considerably boosts the in situ production of bacteria at the base of the food web. An increase in sea-level will only have a major impact on the extent of rocky shore invertebrate communities where shore topography prevents the upward migration of the biota. Where a seawall limits shores, for example, biological production will be curtailed as the area available for colonization decreases. Increases in the size of waves and the frequency of storms will mimic increasing exposure and there will be a significant reduction in algal production in areas that are affected.},

abstract = {Aim MacArthur and Wilson's dynamic equilibrium model of island biogeography provides a powerful framework for understanding the ecological processes acting on insular populations. However, their model is known to be less successful when applied to systems and processes operating on evolutionary and geological timescales. Here, we present a general dynamic model (GDM) of oceanic island biogeography that aims to provide a general explanation of biodiversity patterns through describing the relationships between fundamental biogeographical processes - speciation, immigration, extinction - through time and in relation to island ontogeny. Location Analyses are presented for the Azores, Canaries, Galapagos, Marquesas and Hawaii. Methods We develop a theoretical argument from first principles using a series of graphical models to convey key properties and mechanisms involved in the GDM. Based on the premises (1) that emergent properties of island biotas are a function of rates of immigration, speciation and extinction, (2) that evolutionary dynamics predominate in large, remote islands, and (3) that oceanic islands are relatively short-lived landmasses showing a characteristic humped trend in carrying capacity (via island area, topographic variation, etc.) over their life span, we derive a series of predictions concerning biotic properties of oceanic islands. We test a subset of these predictions using regression analyses based largely on data sets for native species and single-island endemics (SIEs) for particular taxa from each archipelago, and using maximum island age estimates from the literature. The empirical analyses test the power of a simple model of diversity derived from the GDM: the log(Area) + Time + Time(2) model (ATT(2)), relative to other simpler time and area models, using several diversity metrics. Results The ATT(2) model provides a more satisfactory explanation than the alternative models evaluated (for example the standard diversity-area models) in that it fits a higher proportion of the data sets tested, although it is not always the most parsimonious solution. Main conclusions The theoretical model developed herein is based on the key dynamic biological processes (migration, speciation, extinction) combined with a simple but general representation of the life cycle of oceanic islands, providing a framework for explaining patterns of biodiversity, endemism and diversification on a range of oceanic archipelagos. The properties and predictions derived from the model are shown to be broadly supported (1) by the empirical analyses presented, and (2) with reference to previous phylogenetic, ecological and geological studies.},

In plants, tip-growing cells represent an ideal system to investigate signal transduction mechanisms, and among these, pollen tubes (PTs) are one of the favourite models. Many signalling pathways have been identified during germination and tip growth, namely, Ca(2+), calmodulin, phosphoinositides, protein kinases, cyclic AMP, and GTPases. These constitute a large and complex web of signalling networks that intersect at various levels such as the control of vesicle targeting and fusion and the physical state of the actin cytoskeleton. Here we discuss some of the most recent advances made in PT signal transduction cascades and their implications for our future research. For reasons of space, emphasis was given to signalling mechanisms that control PT reorientation, so naturally many other relevant works have not been cited.},

abstract = {Non-protein-coding RNA genes play an important role in various biological processes. How new RNA genes originated and whether this process is controlled by similar evolutionary mechanisms for the origin of protein-coding genes remains unclear. A young chimeric RNA gene that we term sphinx (spx) provides the first insight into the early stage of evolution of RNA genes. spx originated as an insertion of a retroposed sequence of the ATP synthase chain F gene at the cytological region 60DB since the divergence of Drosophila melanogaster from its sibling species 2-3 million years ago. This retrosequence, which is located at 102F on the fourth chromosome, recruited a nearby exon and intron, thereby evolving a chimeric gene structure. This molecular process suggests that the mechanism of exon shuffling, which can generate protein-coding genes, also plays a role in the origin of RNA genes. The subsequent evolutionary process of spx has been associated with a high nucleotide substitution rate, possibly driven by a continuous positive Darwinian selection for a novel function, as is shown in its sex- and development-specific alternative splicing. To test whether spx has adapted to different environments, we investigated its population genetic structure in the unique "Evolution Canyon" in Israel, revealing a similar haplotype structure in spx, and thus similar evolutionary forces operating on spx between environments.},

The intracellular images reveal that lily pollen tubes possess a constitutive alkaline band at the base of the clear zone and an acidic domain at the extreme apex. The extracellular observations, in close agreement, show a proton influx at the extreme apex of the pollen tube and an efflux in the region that corresponds to the position of the alkaline band. The ability to detect the intracellular pH gradient is strongly dependent on the concentration of exogenous buffers in the cytoplasm. Thus, even the indicator dye, if introduced at levels estimated to be of 1.0 microM or greater, will dissipate the gradient, possibly through shuttle buffering. The apical acidic domain correlates closely with the process of growth, and thus may play a direct role, possibly in facilitating vesicle movement and exocytosis. The alkaline band correlates with the position of the reverse fountain streaming at the base of the clear zone, and may participate in the regulation of actin filament formation through the modulation of pH-sensitive actin binding proteins. These studies not only demonstrate that proton gradients exist, but that they may be intimately associated with polarized pollen tube growth.},

The whole-cell inward currents in the isolated pollen protoplasts were activated at hyperpolarized membrane potentials more negative than -100 mV. The magnitudes of the whole-cell inward currents were strongly dependent on the external K+ concentration, and were highly selective for K+ over other monovalent cations. The inward currents were not observed when external K+ was replaced with the same concentration of Cs+ or Na+. The addition of 1 mM or 10 mM Ba2+ in external solutions resulted in 30{\%} or 80{\%} inhibition of the inward currents at -180 mV, respectively. These results demonstrated that the inward K+ currents mainly account for the recorded whole-cell inward currents in Brassica pollen protoplasts. Increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations from 10 nM to 30 microM or even 5 mM did not affect the inward K+ currents. Decrease of external Ca2+ concentrations from 10 mM to 1 mM inhibited the inward K+ currents by 25{\%}, while the increase of external Ca2+ from 10 mM to 50 mM almost completely blocked the inward K+ currents. Physiological importance of K+ transport into pollen and its possible regulatory mechanisms are also discussed.},

In contrast, the PIWI proteins are predominantly present in the germline and associate with a novel class of small RNAs known as PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Tens of thousands of piRNA species, typically 24-32 nucleotide (nt) long, have been found in mammals, zebrafish, and Drosophila. Most piRNAs appear to be generated from a small number of long single-stranded RNA precursors that are often encoded by repetitive intergenic sequences in the genome. PIWI proteins play crucial roles during germline development and gametogenesis of many metazoan species, from germline determination and germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance to meiosis, spermiogenesis, and transposon silencing. These diverse functions may involve piRNAs and may be achieved via novel mechanisms of epigenetic and posttranscriptional regulation.},

abstract = {K+ channels play diverse roles in mediating K+ transport and in modulating the membrane potential in higher plant cells during growth and development. Some of the diversity in K+ channel functions may arise from the regulated expression of multiple genes encoding different K+ channel polypeptides. Here we report the isolation of a novel Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA (AKT2) that is highly homologous to the two previously identified K+ channel genes, KAT1 and AKT1. This cDNA mapped to the center of chromosome 4 by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and was highly expressed in leaves, whereas AKT1 was mainly expressed in roots. In addition, we show that diversity in K+ channel function may be attributable to differences in expression levels. Increasing KAT1 expression in Xenopus oocytes by polyadenylation of the KAT1 mRNA increased the current amplitude and led to higher levels of KAT1 protein, as assayed in western blots. The increase in KAT1 expression in oocytes produced shifts in the threshold potential for activation to more positive membrane potentials and decreased half-activation times. These results suggest that different levels of expression and tissue-specific expression of different K+ channel isoforms can contribute to the functional diversity of plant K+ channels. The identification of a highly expressed, leaf-specific K+ channel homolog in plants should allow further molecular characterization of K+ channel functions for physiological K+ transport processes in leaves.},

This essay concentrates on one aspect of this process, the codification of research into "primitive" or "indigenous" knowledge, especially knowledge that was transmitted orally, and argues that such investigations were a by-product of four interrelated phenomena: the globalization of the sciences themselves, particularly those fields that took the earth and its inhabitants as their object of analysis; the professionalization of anthropology and its growing emphasis on studying other cultures' medical, technical, and natural knowledge; the European push, in the late nineteenth century, toward "global colonialism" and the ethnographic research that accompanied colonial state building; and, finally, colonized and marginalized peoples' challenges to scientific epistemologies and their paradoxical call that scientists study their knowledge systems more carefully. These phenomena came together on a global scale in the decades surrounding the turn of the twentieth century to produce a subgenre of research within the sciences, here labeled "vernacular science," focused explicitly on "native" knowledge.},

abstract = {We examined emergence of male and female 13-yr periodical cicadas (Brood XIX) and mortality, due to avian predation, fungal infection (Massospora cicadina), environmental factors, and senescence. We compared relative contributions of the sources of mortality, and determined the temporal pattern of avian predation associated with predator satiation and mortality. Based on a mean density of 6.65 emergence holes/m2, we estimated that 1 063 300 cicadas emerged on our 16-ha study area in northwestern Arkansas during May 1985. Males appeared first in emergence traps in early May and emerged more synchronously than did females. About 50{\%} of the population emerged during four consecutive nights, and peak abundance of adult cicadas occurred in late May. Based on samples from mortality traps, at least 40{\%} of the population died in severe thunderstorms during the first week of June, demonstrating that stochastic factors can be major influences on periodical cicada populations. Fungal infection was not a major source of mortality. The first cicadas that emerged in early May were eaten by birds, but avian predators became satiated. Birds consumed 15-40{\%} of the standing crop at low cicada densities, but very little of the standing crop was consumed when cicada densities were > 24 000 individuals/ha on the study site. Avian predators appeared to be satiated for several weeks, and by the time their foraging activities increased due to demands imposed by feeding young, density of adult cicadas was relatively low. Mortality due to predation gradually increased to near 100{\%} as the density of adult cicadas declined in June. Based on estimates of cicada emergence and deaths due to avian predation where adult cicada activity was greatest, birds consumed only almost-equal-to 15{\%} of the adult cicada population. Therefore, only a small proportion of the adult cicada population was actually consumed by avian predators. These results demonstrate that, indeed, the synchronized, explosive emergences of periodical cicadas may be classical examples of predator satiation.},

In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, nine genes coding for K+ channel alpha-subunits have been identified. When co-expressed in heterologous expression systems, most of them display the ability to form heteromeric K+ channels. Till now it was not clear whether plants use this potential of heteromerization to increase the functional diversity of potassium channels. Here, we designed an experimental approach employing different transgenic plant lines that allowed us to prove the existence of heteromeric K+ channels in plants. The chosen strategy might also be useful for investigating the activity and function of other multimeric channel proteins like, for instance, cyclic-nucleotide gated channels, tandem-pore K+ channels and glutamate receptor channels.},

abstract = {Salmonella tester strain TA102 carries the hisG428 ochre mutation on the multicopy plasmid pAQ1. DNA sequence analysis of 45 spontaneous revertants of hisG428 on the chromosome in the presence of pKM101 (strain TA103) indicates that hisG428 revertants fall into three major categories: (i) small, in-frame deletions (3 or 6 base pairs) that remove part or all of the ochre triplet; (ii) base substitution mutations at the ochre site; (iii) extragenic ochre suppressors. Deletion revertants are identified in a simple phenotypic screen by their resistance to the inhibitory histidine analog thiazolealanine, which feedback inhibits the wild-type hisG enzyme but not the enzyme resulting from the deletions. The effect of various genetic backgrounds on the generation of spontaneous deletion revertants was examined. The error-prone repair system encoded in the pKM101 plasmid markedly increased the frequency of total spontaneous reversion events in all genetic backgrounds except recA but did not affect the frequency of spontaneous deletion revertants in any background except polA. The presence of a polA mutation increased the frequency of spontaneous deletion revertants by 2-fold in the absence of pKM101 and by 20-fold with pKM101. The presence of a uvrB mutation or a recA mutation suppressed the generation of spontaneous deletion revertants to approximately 1/2.5. When hisG428 was in multiple copies on pAQ1, the frequency of spontaneous deletion revertants increased by 40-fold, which is the approximate copy number of pAQ1. Mutagenic agents that induce single-strand breaks in DNA (e.g., x-rays, bleomycin, and nalidixic acid) induced deletion revertants in TA102. These agents induced deletion revertants only in hisG428 on pAQ1 and only in the presence of pKM101. Deletion revertants were not induced by frameshift mutagens (i.e., ICR-191 and 9-aminoacridine). These results indicate that different pathways exist for the generation of spontaneous and mutagen-induced deletion revertants of hisG428.},

abstract = {The Avabidopsis thaliana K+ channel AKT1 was expressed in a yeast strain defective for K+ uptake at low K+ concentrations (<3 mM). Besides restoring K+ transport in this strain, AKT1 expression increased its tolerance to salt (NaCl or LiCl), whatever the external K+ concentration used (50 mu M, 5 mM, or 50 mM), We took advantage of the latter phenomenon for screening a library of channels randomly mutated in the region that shares homologies with the pore forming domain (the so-called P domain) of animal K+ channels (Shaker family). Cassette mutagenesis was performed using a degenerate oligonucleotide that was designed to ensure, theoretically, a single mutation per P cassette. The mean number of amino acid exchanges per cassette turned out to be 1.4, Mutant channels that conferred on the transformed cells a reduction in salt tolerance (increased Na+ content, decreased K+ content, and lower growth rate, as compared to control cells expressing the wild-type channel) were selected. By co-expressing them with the wild-type AKT1 cDNA, it was shown that the mutated polypeptides were expressed, stable and correctly targeted to the cell membrane where they formed channels with altered properties. Analysis of the mutation distribution in these channels suggests that the AKT1 P domain has a structure similar to that of animal Shaker channels (a strongly constrained central region lining the tunnel that includes the highly conserved consensus motif TXXTXGYGD, and flanking regions forming the outer mouth of the pare), with an additional selectivity filter located upstream from the tunnel and formed by residues present in the N-terminal flanking region.},

An external acidification from 7.4 to 6.4 had similar effects. It is proposed that pH changes regulate the number of channels available for activation.

The largest product formed under the direction of the viral RNA is the same size as the polyprotein thought to represent translation of the entire RNA. Synthesis of this polyprotein and other large products was stimulated greatly by increasing the salt concentration during the reaction from the optimum for initiation (90 mM) to the optimum for elongation (155 mM). Only one initiation peptide could be identified, and a tryptic digest of the product contained mainly peptides that cochromatographed with peptides from authentic viral proteins. The RNA from a deletion mutant of poliovirus initiated protein synthesis at the same site used by standard RNA and programmed synthesis of an appropriately deleted set of polypeptides. The results strongly support the model of translation of poliovirus RNA from a single initiation site into a continuous polyprotein that is cleaved to form the functional proteins. It is suggested that uninfected HeLa cell extracts can carry out the cleavages of nascent polyprotein.},

abstract = {In developing red data books of threatened species, the World Conservation Union uses measures of rarity, rates of decline, and population fragmentation to categorize species according to their risk of extinction. However, most quantitative measures of these three concepts are sensitive to the scale at which they are made. In particular, definitions of rarity based on an area-of-occupancy threshold can nearly always be met if area of occupancy is calculated from a sufficiently fine-scale (high-resolution) grid. Recommendations for dealing with scale dependency include (1) choosing a standard scale of measurement, (2) using multiple scales of measurement, and (3) developing indices that combine information from multiple scales. As an example of the second and third approach, the construction of a species' scale-area curve represents a unifying method for quantifying all three indicators of extinction risk-rarity, rate of decline, and population fragmentation-as functions of area of occupancy and measurement scale. A multiscale analysis is also of practical importance because measurements made at different scales are relevant to different extinction processes. Coarse-scale measures of rarity are most appropriate when threat is assessed on the basis of spatially autocorrelated events of a large extent, such as global climate change, whereas fine-scale measures may best predict extinction risk due to local processes such as demographic stochasticity. We illustrate our arguments with a case study of the British distributions of two related plant species that show a 200-fold reversal in their relative rarity when measured at different scales.},

The behaviour of individual dogwhelks was quantified over three, approximately 40 day, periods on the rocky shores of Llanddwyn Island, Anglesey. Dogwhelks were monitored in a range of habitats, from sheltered, high shore, barnacle covered substrata to wave exposed, low shore, mussel covered substrata. The proportion of dogwhelks either foraging or sheltering varied greatly from day to day, indicating similarity of behaviour among individuals within each population. In sheltered areas, foraging was limited during periods of sunny and warm weather. In exposed areas, however, foraging was restricted during periods of strong wave action. Most dogwhelks in exposed areas foraged in periods of calm, warm and sunny weather.Transplanted dogwhelks appeared initially to be more active foragers than non-transplanted, control, animals in both exposed and sheltered areas. After about 10 days, however, the transplants began to behave in a similar way to the controls. },

abstract = {The location and changes in NAD(P)H have been monitored during oscillatory growth in pollen tubes of lily (Lilium formosanum) using the endogenous fluorescence of the reduced coenzyme (excitation, 360 nm; emission, >400 nm). The strongest signal resides 20 to 40 microm behind the apex where mitochondria (stained with Mitotracker Green) accumulate. Measurements at 3-s intervals reveal that NAD(P)H-dependent fluorescence oscillates during oscillatory growth. Cross-correlation analysis indicates that the peaks follow growth maxima by 7 to 11 s or 77 degrees to 116 degrees, whereas the troughs anticipate growth maxima by 5 to 10 s or 54 degrees to 107 degrees. We have focused on the troughs because they anticipate growth and are as strongly correlated with growth as the peaks. Analysis of the signal in 10-microm increments along the length of the tube indicates that the troughs are most advanced in the extreme apex. However, this signal moves basipetally as a wave, being in phase with growth rate oscillations at 50 to 60 microm from the apex. We suggest that the changes in fluorescence are due to an oscillation between the reduced (peaks) and oxidized (troughs) states of the coenzyme and that an increase in the oxidized state [NAD(P)(+)] may be coupled to the synthesis of ATP. We also show that diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of NAD(P)H dehydrogenases, causes an increase in fluorescence and a decrease in tube growth. Finally, staining with 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorohydrofluorescein acetate indicates that reactive oxygen species are most abundant in the region where mitochondria accumulate and where NAD(P)H fluorescence is maximal.},

abstract = {In plants, cyclic GMP is involved in signal transduction in response to light and gibberellic acid. For cyclic AMP, a potential role during the plant cell cycle was recently reported. However, cellular targets for cyclic nucleotides in plants are largely unknown. Here we report on the identification and characterisation of a new gene family in Arabidopsis, which share features with cyclic nucleotide-gated channels from animals and inward-rectifying K+ channels from plants. The identified gene family comprises six members (Arabidopsis thaliana cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, AtCNGC1-6) with significant homology among the deduced proteins. Hydrophobicity analysis predicted six membrane-spanning domains flanked by hydrophilic amino and carboxy termini. A putative cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) which contains several residues that are invariant in other CNBDs was located in the carboxy terminus. This domain overlaps with a predicted calmodulin (CaM) binding site, suggesting interaction between cyclic nucleotide and CaM regulation. We demonstrated interaction of the carboxy termini of AtCNGC1 and AtCNGC2 with CaM in yeast, indicating that the CaM binding sites are functional. Furthermore, it was shown that both AtCNGC1 and AtCNGC2 can partly complement the K(+)-uptake-deficient yeast mutant CY162. Therefore, we propose that the identified genes constitute a family of plant cyclic nucleotide- and CaM-regulated ion channels.},

abstract = {Olfactory receptors likely constitute the largest gene superfamily in the vertebrate genome. Here we present the nearly complete human olfactory subgenome elucidated by mining the genome draft with gene discovery algorithms. Over 900 olfactory receptor genes and pseudogenes (ORs) were identified, two-thirds of which were not annotated previously. The number of extrapolated ORs is in good agreement with previous theoretical predictions. The sequence of at least 63{\%} of the ORs is disrupted by what appears to be a random process of pseudogene formation. ORs constitute 17 gene families, 4 of which contain more than 100 members each. "Fish-like" Class I ORs, previously considered a relic in higher tetrapods, constitute as much as 10{\%} of the human repertoire, all in one large cluster on chromosome ii. Their lower pseudogene fraction suggests a functional significance. ORs are disposed on all human chromosomes except 20 and Y, and nearly 80{\%} are found in clusters of 6-138 genes. A novel comparative cluster analysis was used to trace the evolutionary path that may have led to OR proliferation and diversification throughout the genome. The results of this analysis suggest the following genome expansion history: first, the generation of a "tetrapod-specific" Class II OR cluster on chromosome 11 by local duplication, then a single-step duplication of this cluster to chromosome I, and finally an avalanche of duplication events out of chromosome 1 to most other chromosomes. The results of the data mining and characterization of ORs can be accessed at the Human Olfactory Receptor Data Exploratorium Web site (http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/HORDE).},

The composition of the individual ion channels and the functional contribution of different alpha-subunits is largely unknown. Focusing on K(+)-selective ion channels, we have characterized AtKC1, a new alpha-subunit from the Arabidopsis shaker-like ion channel family. Promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) studies identified AtKC1 expression predominantly in root hairs and root endodermis. Specific antibodies recognized AtKC1 at the plasma membrane. To analyze further the abundance and the functional contribution of the different K(+) channels alpha-subunits in root cells, we performed real-time reverse transcription-PCR and patch-clamp experiments on isolated root hair protoplasts. Studying all shaker-like ion channel alpha-subunits, we only found the K(+) inward rectifier AtKC1 and AKT1 and the K(+) outward rectifier GORK to be expressed in this cell type. Akt1 knockout plants essentially lacked inward rectifying K(+) currents. In contrast, inward rectifying K(+) currents were present in AtKC1 knockout plants, but fundamentally altered with respect to gating and cation sensitivity. This indicates that the AtKC1 alpha-subunit represents an integral component of functional root hair K(+) uptake channels.},

Among these mysteries is the differentiation of four distinct organ types (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels), each of which may be a modified leaf(1). A landmark accomplishment in plant developmental biology is the ABC model of flower organ identity(2,3). This simple model provides a conceptual framework for explaining how the individual and combined activities of the ABC genes produce the four organ types of the typical eudicot flower. Here we show that the activities of the B and C organ-identity genes require the activities of three closely related and functionally redundant MADS-box genes, SEPALLATA1/2/3 (SEP1/2/3). Triple mutant Arabidopsis plants lacking the activity of all three SEP genes produce flowers in which all organs develop as sepals. Thus SEP1/2/3 are a class of organ-identity genes that is required for development of petals, stamens and carpels.},

However, no molecule has been convincingly demonstrated to be the true attractant that actually controls the navigation of pollen tubes in the pistil. The past decade has seen substantial progress in this field in terms of our understanding of the various mechanisms of pollen tube guidance. It was suggested that diffusible pollen tube attractants might provide localized signals that affect the directional growth of the pollen tube, especially in the last phase of guidance by the target female gametophyte. Here, we review the mechanisms of pollen tube guidance, with special focus on the gametophytic guidance and the attractant. The necessary and appropriate conditions required by the true attractant will be discussed.},

abstract = {Anthocyanins belong to a large group of secondary plant metabolites collectively known as flavonoids, a subclass of the polyphenol family. They are a group of very efficient bioactive compounds that are widely distributed in plant food. Anthocyanins occur in all plant tissues, including leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and fruits. Research on phenolic compounds through the last century, from the chemical, biochemical, and biological points of view, has focused mainly on the anthocyanins. Anthocyanins have structures consisting of two aromatic rings linked by three carbons in an oxygenated heterocycle (i.e., a chromane ring bearing a second aromatic ring in position 2). The basic chromophore of anthocyanins is the 7-hydroxyflavilyum ion. Anthocyanin pigments consist of two or three chemical units: an aglycon base or flavylium ring (anthocyanidin), sugars, and possibly acylating groups. Only six of the different anthocyanidins found in nature occur frequently and are of dietary importance: cyanidin, delphinidin, petunidin, peonidin, pelargonidin, and malvidin. Each aglycon may be glycosilated or acylated by different sugars and aromatic or aliphatic acids, yielding over 600 different anthocyanins reported from plants. The sugar moiety is typically attached at the 3-position on the C-ring or the 5-position on the A-ring. The chromophore of eight conjugate double bonds carrying a positive charge on the heterocyclic oxygen ring is responsible for the intensive red-orange to blue-violet color produced by anthocyanins under acidic conditions. Anthocyanins occur in solution as a mixture of different secondary structures: flavylium ion, a quinoidal base, a carbinol base, and a chalcone pseudobase. Self-association, intermolecular, and intramolecular co-pigmentation of anthocyanins leads to the formation of tertiary structures through varying stabilization mechanisms. Anthocyanin composition has been used as a botanical tool for taxonomic classification of plants. In addition, anthocyanin profiles of fruits and vegetables allow detecting adulteration of anthocyanin-based products and are indicators of product quality. Anthocyanins are common components of the human diet, as they are present in many foods, fruits, and vegetables, especially in berries. Moreover, anthocyanins have an antioxidant activity, depending to a large extent upon their chemical structure. Many epidemiological studies have shown the benefits of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables to human health, and for the prevention of various diseases associated with oxidative stress, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Anthocyanin-rich extracts are increasingly attractive to the food industry as natural alternatives to synthetic FD{\&}C dyes and lakes, because of their coloring properties. Anthocyanins are also one of the nine European Union-designated natural color classes. Various adverse effects on health have frequently been attributed to synthetic antioxidants. For these reasons, currently, there is a trend towards relying on antioxidants derived from natural products. Anthocyanins act as antioxidants both in the foodstuffs in which they are found and in the organism after intake of these foods. This review, like the first one of the series, intends to reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the research that is currently carried out in this prolific area.},

abstract = {Actin polymerization is important in the control of pollen tube growth. Thus, treatment of pollen tubes with low concentrations of latrunculin B (Lat-B), which inhibits actin polymerization, permits streaming but reversibly blocks oscillatory growth. In the current study, we employ Jasplakinolide (Jas), a sponge cyclodepsipeptide that stabilizes actin microfilaments and promotes polymerization. Uniquely, Jas (2 microM) blocks streaming in the shank of the tube, but induces the formation of a toroidal-shaped domain in the swollen apex, of which longitudinal optical sections exhibit circles of motion. The polarity of this rotary motion is identical to that of reverse fountain motility in control pollen tubes, with the forward direction occurring at the edge of the cell and the rearward direction in the cell interior. Support for the idea that actin polymerization in the apical domain contributes to the formation of this rotary motility activity derives from the appearance therein of aggregates and flared cables of F-actin, using immunofluorescence, and by the reduction in G-actin as indicated with fluorescent DNAse. In addition, Jas reduces the tip-focused Ca2+ gradient. However, the alkaline band appears in the swollen apex and is spatially localized with the reverse fountain streaming activity. Taken together, our results support the idea that actin polymerization promotes reversal of streaming in the apex of the lily pollen tube.},

abstract = {We discuss the structural homology of the gynoecium and the developmental variations associated with ovary diversity in Saxifragaceae. Diverse ovary positions are present within most of the major clades in the family. We demonstrate that superior ovaries, although widely reported for various members of the family, are unusual and limited to a few species of Micranthes and Saxifraga and to male flowers of the dioecious Tanakaea among investigated genera. Most species reported to have superior ovaries actually have developmentally epigynous flowers in which the ovary has a small portion below the insertion of the perianth and androecium. Such ovaries of epigynous flowers that mimic superior ovaries are termed "pseudosuperior." Labile shifts in proportioned growth of that part of the ovary above the insertion of the perianth and androecium to that below their insertion have created extensive variation in ovary position among closely related taxa, e. g., in both Saxifraga and Micranthes. The heterostylous Jepsonia has differences in ovary position among the different style-length morphs, and similar variation in ovary position may be present in the dioecious Tanakaea. Epigynous flowers of Saxifragaceae fit the model of appendicular epigyny. During the organogenetic phase of early floral development, they exhibit peripheral upgrowth of the apical region, which forms a central concavity. The initial gynoecial primordium forms on the inner slope of the concavity, zonal growth in the concave flank subjacent to the initial gynoecial primordium elongates, and subsequently, the tissue lining the concave flank below the initial gynoecial primordium differentiates as ovary.},

abstract = {In Drosophila, Piwi (P-element-induced wimpy testis), which encodes a protein of the Argonaute family, is essential for germ stem cell self-renewal. Piwi has recently been shown to be a nuclear protein involved in gene silencing of retrotransposons and controlling their mobilization in the male germline. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of Piwi-dependent gene silencing. Here we show that endogenous Piwi immunopurified from ovary specifically associates with small RNAs of 25-29 nucleotides in length. Piwi-associated small RNAs were identified by cloning and sequencing as repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs) derived from repetitive regions, such as retrotransposon and heterochromatic regions, in the Drosophila genome. Northern blot analyses revealed that in vivo Piwi does not associate with microRNAs (miRNAs) and that guide siRNA was not loaded onto Piwi when siRNA duplex was added to ovary lysate. In vitro, recombinant Piwi exhibits target RNA cleavage activity. These data together imply that Piwi functions in nuclear RNA silencing as Slicer by associating specifically with rasiRNAs originating from repetitive targets.},

In delving into the roles of the Drosophila Akh (dAkh) gene, its developmental expression patterns were examined and the physiological functions of the AKH-producing neurons were investigated using animals devoid of AKH neurons and ones with ectopically expressing dAkh. The dAkh gene is expressed exclusively in the corpora cardiaca from late embryos to adult stages. Projections emanating from the AKH neurons indicated that AKH has multiple target tissues as follows: the prothoracic gland and aorta in the larva and the crop and brain in the adult. Studies using transgenic manipulations of the dAkh gene demonstrated that AKH induced both hypertrehalosemia and hyperlipemia. Starved wild-type flies displayed prolonged hyperactivity prior to death; this novel behavioral pattern could be associated with food-searching activities in response to starvation. In contrast, flies devoid of AKH neurons not only lacked this type of hyperactivity, but also displayed strong resistance to starvation-induced death. From these findings, we propose another role for AKH in the regulation of starvation-induced foraging behavior.},

abstract = {As it is the case for non-coding regions, the coding regions of organisms can be expanded or shrunk during evolutionary processes. However, the dynamics of coding regions are expected to be more correlated with functional complexity and diversity than are the dynamics of non-coding regions. Hence, it is interesting to investigate the increase of diversity in coding regions - the origin and evolution of new genes - because this provides a new component to the genetic variation underlying the diversity of living organisms. Here, we examine what is known about the mechanisms responsible for the increase in gene number. Every mechanism affects genomes in a distinct way and to a different extent and it appears that certain organisms favor particular mechanisms. The detail of some interesting gene acquisitions reveals the extreme dynamism of genomes. Finally, we discuss what is known about the fate of new genes and conclude that many of the acquisitions are likely to have been driven by natural selection; they increase functional complexity, diversity, and/or adaptation of species. Despite this, the correlation between complexity of life and gene number is low and closely related species (with very similar life histories) can have very different number of genes. We call this phenomenon the G-value paradox.},

abstract = {The P instability factor or PIF superfamily of DNA transposons constitutes an important group of transposable elements (TEs) in plants, but it is still poorly characterized in metazoans. Taking advantage of the availability of draft genome sequences for twelve Drosophila species, we discovered 4 different lineages of Drosophila PIF-like transposons, named DPLT1-4. These lineages have experienced a complex evolutionary history during the Drosophila radiation, involving differential amplification and retention among species and probable events of horizontal transmission. Like previously described plant and animal PIF transposons, full-length DPLTs encode a putative transposase as well as a second predicted protein containing a Myb/SANT domain. In DPLTs, this domain is most closely related to the MADF DNA-binding domain found in several Drosophila transcription factors. In addition, we identified 7 distinct genes distributed across the Drosophila genus that encode proteins related to PIF transposases, but lack the hallmarks of transposons. Instead, these sequences show features of functional genes, such as an intact coding region evolving under purifying selection, the presence of orthologs in at least 2 Drosophila species, and the conservation of intron/exon structure across orthologs. We also provide evidence that most of these genes are transcribed and that some are developmentally regulated. Together the data indicate that these genes derived from PIF-transposons that have been "domesticated" to serve cellular functions. In one instance the recruitment of the transposase gene was accompanied by the co-recruitment of the adjacent second PIF gene, which raises the hypothesis that both proteins now function in the same pathway. The second PIF gene has retained the capacity to encode a protein with an intact MADF domain, suggesting that it may function as a transcription factor. We conclude that PIF transposons are common in the Drosophila lineage and have been a recurrent source of new genes during Drosophila evolution.},

abstract = {The hereditary stomatocytoses (HSt) are a diverse group of conditions. Common features include hemolytic anemia, a red cell cation leak and morphological changes, but the severity of the condition can vary enormously. We have previously shown that one form of HSt (cryohydrocytosis), where the monovalent cation leak is increased at low temperature, results from amino acid substitutions in the membrane domain of band 3 (anion exchanger 1, SLC4A1). These substitutions appear to convert band 3 from an anion exchanger into a cation channel. More recently we found that over-hydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (OHSt) results from amino acid substitutions in Rh-associated glycoprotein (RhAG), a putative gas channel protein. Both band 3 and RhAG associate in the red cell membrane to form a macrocomplex that is thought to be involved in red cell gas exchange. In this paper I will review the data that has been published so far on the molecular basis of HSt. I will mention other similar conditions that cause either a cation leak or stomatocytosis or both, and consider the mechanisms of red cell shape change and permeability. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Gradmann1998,
abstract = {There are five major electroenzymes in the plasmalemma of plant cells: a driving electrogenic pump, inward and outward rectifying K+ channels, a Cl--2H+ symporter, and Cl--channels. It has been demonstrated previously (Gradmann, Blatt {\&} Thiel 1993, J. Membrane Biol. 136:327-332) how voltage-gating of these electroenzymes causes oscillations of the transmembrane voltage (V) at constant substrate concentrations. The purpose of this study is to examine the interaction of the same transporter ensemble with cytoplasmic concentrations of K+ and Cl-. The former model system has been extended to account for changing internal concentrations. Constant-field theory has been applied to describe the influence of ion concentrations on current-voltage relationships of the active channels. The extended model is investigated using a reference set of model parameters. In this configuration, the system converges to stable slow oscillations with intrinsic changes in cytoplasmic K+ and Cl- concentrations. These slow oscillations reflect alternation between a state of salt uptake at steady negative values of V and a state of net salt loss at rapidly oscillating V, the latter being analogous to the previously reported oscillations. By switching off either concentration changes or gating, it is demonstrated that the fast oscillations are mostly due to the gating properties of the Cl- channel, whereas the slow oscillations are controlled by the effect of the Cl- concentration on the current. The sensitivity of output results y (e.g., frequency of oscillations) to changes of the model parameters x (e.g., maximum Cl- conductance) has been investigated for the reference system. Further examples are presented where some larger changes of specific model parameters cause fundamentally different behavior, e.g., convergence towards a stable state of only the fast oscillations without intrinsic concentration changes, or to a steady-state without any oscillations. The main and general result of this study is that the osmotic status of a plant cell is stabilized by the ensemble of familiar electroenzymes through oscillatory interactions with the internal concentrations of the most abundant ions. This convergent behavior of the stand-alone system is an important prerequisite for osmotic regulation by means of other physiological mechanisms, like second messengers and gating modifiers.},

abstract = {Here we report on the molecular identification, guard cell expression and functional characterization of AtGORK, an Arabidopsis thaliana guard cell outward rectifying K+ channel. GORK represents a new member of the plant Shaker K+ channel superfamily. When heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes the gene product of GORK mediated depolarization-activated K+ currents. In agreement with the delayed outward rectifier in intact guard cells and protoplasts thereof, GORK is activated in a voltage- and potassium-dependent manner. Furthermore, the single channel conductance and regulation of GORK in response to pH changes resembles the biophysical properties of the guard cell delayed outward rectifier. Thus GORK very likely represents the molecular entity for depolarization-induced potassium release from guard cells. (C) 2000 Federation of European Biochemical Socities.},

abstract = {We present evidence of ecological character displacement among species of three-spined sticklebacks that inhabit small lakes of coastal British Columbia. Geological data suggest that the populations resulted from multiple divergence and speciation events over the past 13,000 yr. In lakes with two species, one is invariably "limnetic" in morphology and habitat, and the other is "benthic." Other lakes contain a single form morphologically intermediate between sympatric species and exploiting both habitats. Within solitary populations individuals exploit one habitat or the other according to their morphology, which underscores the divergent selection pressures operating on either side of the habitat boundary. Our results satisfy at least four of the six major criteria for demonstrating the occurrence of character displacement: (1) a statistical null model of no displacement is easily rejected; (2) variation between and within populations is genetically based; (3) differences in sympatry reflect evolutionary shifts, not merely the biased extinction of similar forms; and (4) morphology is closely linked to resource use. Minimal resource differences between one- and two-species lakes and the presence of competition between similar phenotypes are still to be established. Our data suggest that competition for food has played a critical role in the divergence between species. We consider the possibility that it also helped in species formation, which would expand its potential role in adaptive radiation.},

abstract = {The growth and metabolism of plants in response to different concentrations of tissue K is discussed in relation to current knowledge about the distribution and functions of this ion in plant cells. In the cytoplasm, K has an important role in providing the correct ionic environment for metabolic processes. The ionic requirements of protein synthesis seem to be particularly important in determining the composition of the cytoplasm. Potassium is not replaceable in its cytoplasmic functions and the plant probably needs to maintain the cytoplasmic concentration of K in the range of 100 to 200 mM. Potassium salts in the vacuole are involved in the generation of turgor but when unavailable they can be replaced by other solutes. Salts of other cations such as Na and Mg are often a readily available alternative to K but in their absence organic solutes must be accumulated. With these observations as a basis, a model is proposed in which, as the concentration of K in the tissue declines, the concentration in the cytoplasm is initially maintained constant, while that in the vacuole decreases. In order to maintain turgor, alternative solutes are accumulated in the vacuole as replacements for K. It is assumed that K in the vacuole can only drop to a certain minimum level and, once this is reached, any further decline of tissue K must be at the expense of that in the cytoplasm. This leads to a decrease in the rate of metabolic processes that depend on K and so to a decline in growth. The hypothesis explains the observed relationships between growth and concentrations of K in tissues, and their modification by Na and other cations.},

abstract = {In plants a large diversity of inwardly rectifying K+ channels (K(in) channels) has been observed between tissues and species. However, only three different types of voltage-dependent plant K+ uptake channel subfamilies have been cloned so far; they relate either to KAT1, AKT1, or AtKC1. To explore the mechanisms underlying the channel diversity, we investigated the assembly of plant inwardly rectifying alpha-subunits. cRNA encoding five different K+ channel alpha-subunits of the three subfamilies (KAT1, KST1, AKT1, SKT1, and AtKC1) which were isolated from different tissues, species, and plant families (Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum tuberosum) was reciprocally co-injected into Xenopus oocytes. We identified plant K+ channels as multimers. Moreover, using K+ channel mutants expressing different sensitivities to voltage, Cs+, Ca2+, and H+, we could prove heteromers on the basis of their altered voltage and modulator susceptibility. We discovered that, in contrast to animal K+ channel alpha-subunits, functional aggregates of plant K(in) channel alpha-subunits assembled indiscriminately. Interestingly, AKT-type channels from A. thaliana and S. tuberosum, which as homomers were electrically silent in oocytes after co-expression, mediated K+ currents. Our findings suggest that K+ channel diversity in plants results from nonselective heteromerization of different alpha-subunits, and thus depends on the spatial segregation of individual alpha-subunit pools and the degree of temporal overlap and kinetics of expression.},

(i) Homo logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to a sequence composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method (FFT-NS-2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT-NS-i), are implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT-NS-2 and FFT-NS-i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT-NS-2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT-NS-i is over 100 times faster than T-COFFEE, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

abstract = {Currently, there are strong inconsistencies in our knowledge of plant heterotrimeric G-proteins that suggest the existence of additional members of the family. We have identified a new Arabidopsis G-protein $\gamma$-subunit (AGG3) that modulates morphological development and ABA-regulation of stomatal aperture. AGG3 strongly interacts with the Arabidopsis G-protein $\beta$-subunit in vivo and in vitro. Most importantly, AGG3-deficient mutants account for all but one of the 'orphan' phenotypes previously unexplained by the two known $\gamma$-subunits in Arabidopsis. AGG3 has unique characteristics never before observed in plant or animal systems, such as its size (more than twice that of canonical $\gamma$-subunits) and the presence of a C-terminal Cys-rich domain. AGG3 thus represent a novel class of G-protein $\gamma$-subunits, widely spread throughout the plant kingdom but not present in animals. Homologues of AGG3 in rice have been identified as important quantitative trait loci for grain size and yield, but due to the atypical nature of the proteins their identity as G-protein subunits was thus far unknown. Our work demonstrates a similar trend in seeds of Arabidopsis agg3 mutants, and implicates G-proteins in such a crucial agronomic trait. The discovery of this highly atypical subunit reinforces the emerging notion that plant and animal G-proteins have distinct as well as shared evolutionary pathways.},

AtCHX17, a member of the CPA2 family, was selected for expression studies, and phenotypic analysis of knockout mutants was performed. AtCHX17 expression was only detected in roots. The gene was strongly induced by salt stress, potassium starvation, abscisic acid (ABA) and external acidic pH. Using the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene strategy and in situ RT-PCR experiments, we have found that AtCHX17 was expressed preferentially in epidermal and cortical cells of the mature root zones. Knockout mutants accumulated less K(+) in roots in response to salt stress and potassium starvation compared with the wild type.

abstract = {The chimpanzee genome sequence is a long-awaited milestone, providing opportunities to explore primate evolution and genetic contributions to human physiology and disease. Humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor similar to 5-7 million years ago (Mya). The difference between the two genomes is actually not similar to 1{\%}, but similar to 4{\%}-comprising similar to 35 million single nucleotide differences and similar to 90 Mb of insertions and deletions. The challenge is to identify the many evolutionarily, physiologically, and biomedically important differences scattered throughout these genomes while integrating these data with emerging knowledge about the corresponding "phenomes" and the relevant environmental influences. It is logical to tackle the genetic aspects via both genome-wide analyses and candidate gene studies. Genome-wide surveys could eliminate the majority of genomic sequence differences from consideration, while simultaneously identifying potential targets of opportunity. Meanwhile, candidate gene approaches can be based on such genomic surveys, on genes that may contribute to known differences in phenotypes or disease incidence/severity, or on mutations in the human population that impact unique aspects of the human condition. These two approaches will intersect at many levels and should be considered complementary. We also cite some known genetic differences between humans and great apes, realizing that these likely represent only the tip of the iceberg.},

In this study we hypothesised that if anthocyanin expression is an adaptive response to mitigate the stress effects of P deficiency, genotypes with constitutive anthocyanin expression would have greater tolerance to P stress than low anthocyanin-producing genotypes. Four studies were conducted in greenhouse, outdoor chamber and field conditions to compare genetically similar maize and coleus plants with contrasting anthocyanin accumulation (i.e. 'red-leafed' vs 'green-leafed'). In low-P treatments, anthocyanin production did not consistently result in greater photosynthesis or biomass. In coleus, red-leafed phenotypes showed lower chlorophyll a/b ratios suggesting photoprotection by anthocyanins against degradation of light harvesting complex proteins. However, the opposite trend was observed in maize, where red-leafed phenotypes showed greater chlorophyll a/b ratios and lower q(P) (oxidation state of PSII). Based on results from the various treatments and growth conditions of this study, it could not be concluded that high foliar anthocyanin production confers a general functional advantage under low-P stress. More research comparing inducible vs constitutive production may help elucidate the role of anthocyanin biosynthesis in P deficiency responses.},

The nonclustered or divergent homeobox genes include a large number of genes scattered throughout the genome that, nevertheless, can be organized in distinct families based on their homologies and functional similarities.

abstract = {Non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are increasingly being recognized as having important regulatory roles. Although much recent attention has focused on tiny 22- to 25-nucleotide microRNAs, several functional ncRNAs are orders of magnitude larger in size. Examples of such macro ncRNAs include Xist and Air, which in mouse are 18 and 108 kilobases (Kb), respectively. We surveyed the 102,801 FANTOM3 mouse cDNA clones and found that Air and Xist were present not as single, full-length transcripts but as a cluster of multiple, shorter cDNAs, which were unspliced, had little coding potential, and were most likely primed from internal adenine-rich regions within longer parental transcripts. We therefore conducted a genome-wide search for regional clusters of such cDNAs to find novel macro ncRNA candidates. Sixty-six regions were identified, each of which mapped outside known protein-coding loci and which had a mean length of 92 Kb. We detected several known long ncRNAs within these regions, supporting the basic rationale of our approach. In silico analysis showed that many regions had evidence of imprinting and/or antisense transcription. These regions were significantly associated with microRNAs and transcripts from the central nervous system. We selected eight novel regions for experimental validation by northern blot and RT-PCR and found that the majority represent previously unrecognized noncoding transcripts that are at least 10 Kb in size and predominantly localized in the nucleus. Taken together, the data not only identify multiple new ncRNAs but also suggest the existence of many more macro ncRNAs like Xist and Air.},

abstract = {To gain insights into the performance of poplar guard cells, we have measured stomatal conductance and aperture, guard cell K+ content and K+-channel activity of the guard cell plasma membrane in intact poplar leaves. In contrast to Arabidopsis, broad bean and tobacco grown under same conditions, poplar stomata operated just in the dynamic range - any change in conductance altered the rate of photosynthesis. In response to light, CO2 and abscisic acid (ABA), the stomatal opening velocity was two to five times faster than that measured for Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum and Vicia faba. When stomata opened, the K+ content of guard cells increased almost twofold, indicating that the very fast stomatal opening in this species is mediated via potassium uptake. Following impalement of single guard cells embedded in their natural environment of intact leaves with triple-barrelled microelectrodes, time-dependent inward and outward-rectifying K+-channel-mediated currents of large amplitude were recorded. To analyse the molecular nature of genes encoding guard cell K+-uptake channels, we cloned K+-transporter Populustremula (KPT)1 and functionally expressed this potassium channel in a K+-uptake-deficient Escherichia coli mutant. In addition to guard cells, this K+-transporter gene was expressed in buds, where the KPT1 gene activity strongly correlated with bud break. Thus, KPT1 represents one of only few poplar genes associated with bud flush.},

abstract = {Many animals are capable of ingesting food faster than it can be digested, and the resulting constraint on processing rate may significantly affect foraging behaviour. Dynamic models allow physiological factors, including gut-processing rate, gut fulness and energy reserves to be considered in addition to external influences when predicting foraging decisions. Foraging decisions of Nucella lapillus (L.), a predatory gastropod on rocky shores, were predicted using a dynamic-programming model that included energy reserves and gut contents as state variables, with a limited rate of gut processing. Behaviour was simulated using coupled submodels; an initial choice of remaining in a safe, foodless, refuge or foraging at risk in the open, followed by choices of accepting or rejecting prey during a tidally limited period of searching. The optimal decision to refuge or forage appears to be mainly a function of gut contents; below a threshold level, forage, above, remain in shelter. Because of the gut-contents threshold, dogwhelks should be time minimizers when ingestion rate exceeds digestion rate, but energy maximizers when the converse is true. Energy reserves interact with risk of mortality; high values reducing the amount of time when it is optimal to forage. Smaller dogwhelks are more likely to maintain an energy surplus, perhaps explaining the observed decline in asymptotic size on more risky, wave-beaten shores. The diet is predicted to expand to include prey of lower profitabilities as searching time runs out. Contraction of the diet should occur toward higher ranked prey as the gut-contents threshold for sheltering is approached.},

abstract = {A combined bioinformatic and experimental approach is being used to uncover the functions of a novel family of cation/H(+) exchanger (CHX) genes in plants using Arabidopsis as a model. The predicted protein (85-95 kD) of 28 AtCHX genes after revision consists of an amino-terminal domain with 10 to 12 transmembrane spans (approximately 440 residues) and a hydrophilic domain of approximately 360 residues at the carboxyl end, which is proposed to have regulatory roles. The hydrophobic, but not the hydrophilic, domain of plant CHX is remarkably similar to monovalent cation/proton antiporter-2 (CPA2) proteins, especially yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) KHA1 and Synechocystis NhaS4. Reports of characterized fungal and prokaryotic CPA2 indicate that they have various transport modes, including K(+)/H(+) (KHA1), Na(+)/H(+)-K(+) (GerN) antiport, and ligand-gated ion channel (KefC). The expression pattern of AtCHX genes was determined by reverse transcription PCR, promoter-driven beta-glucuronidase expression in transgenic plants, and Affymetrix ATH1 genome arrays. Results show that 18 genes are specifically or preferentially expressed in the male gametophyte, and six genes are highly expressed in sporophytic tissues. Microarray data revealed that several AtCHX genes were developmentally regulated during microgametogenesis. An exciting idea is that CHX proteins allow osmotic adjustment and K(+) homeostasis as mature pollen desiccates and then rehydrates at germination. The multiplicity of CHX-like genes is conserved in higher plants but is not found in animals. Only 17 genes, OsCHX01 to OsCHX17, were identified in rice (Oryza sativa) subsp. japonica, suggesting diversification of CHX in Arabidopsis. These results reveal a novel CHX gene family in flowering plants with potential functions in pollen development, germination, and tube growth.},

abstract = {Recently we isolated a cDNA encoding a tobacco plasma membrane calmodulin-binding channel protein (designated NtCBP4) with a putative cyclic nucleotide-binding domain. Here we analyzed in detail the interaction of NtCBP4 with calmodulin. A full-length recombinant NtCBP4 (81 kDa) expressed in Sf9 insect cells, and the corresponding tobacco membrane protein were solubilized from their respective membrane fractions and partially purified by calmodulin affinity chromatography. NtCBP4 was detected in the eluted fractions using specific antibodies raised against the recombinant protein. By binding [35S]-calmodulin to recombinant NtCBP4 truncations fused to glutathione S-transferase, we identified a single region consisting of 66 amino acids capable of binding calmodulin. A 23 amino acid synthetic peptide from within this region formed a complex with calmodulin in the presence of calcium. We measured the fluorescence of dansyl-calmodulin interacting with this peptide, which revealed a dissociation constant of about 8 nM. The NtCBP4 calmodulin-binding domain was found to perfectly coincide with a phylogenetically conserved alphaC-helix motif of its putative cyclic nucleotide-binding domain. Furthermore, a 23 amino acid region in an equivalent site in the cAMP-binding domain of a mammalian protein kinase regulatory subunit was also found to bind calmodulin. Thus, coinciding calmodulin- and cyclic nucleotide-binding domains may serve as a point of communication between calcium and cyclic nucleotide signal transduction pathways in plants and animals.},

abstract = {The Arabidopsis K(+) channel AKT2 possesses the remarkable property that its voltage threshold for activation can be either within the physiological range (gating mode 1), or shifted towards considerably more positive voltages (gating mode 2). Gating mode 1 AKT2 channels behave as delayed K(+)-selective inward rectifiers; while gating mode 2 AKT2 channels are K(+)-selective 'open leaks' in the physiological range of membrane potential. In the present study we have investigated modulation of AKT2 current by effectors of phosphatases/kinases in COS cells and Xenopus oocytes. These experiments show that (i) dephosphorylation can result in AKT2 channel silencing; and (ii) phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) favors both recruitment of silenced AKT2 channels and transition from gating mode 1 to gating mode 2. Interestingly, phosphorylation of AKT2 by PKA in COS cells and Xenopus oocytes is favored by hyperpolarization. Two PKA phosphorylation sites (S210 and S329) were pinpointed in the region of the pore inner mouth. The role of these phosphorylation sites in the switch between the two gating modes was assessed by electrophysiological characterization of mutant channels. The molecular aspects of AKT2 regulation by phosphorylation, and the possible physiological meaning of such regulation in the plant context, are discussed.},

abstract = {Arabidopsis thaliana plants showed an increased tolerance to high-intensity light when pre-exposed to medium-intensity light. This response, known as light acclimatization, depended on the quantity of light, the period of irradiation, and the quality of light. Among characterized acclimatization-induced cDNA clones, we identified a zinc finger protein rhl41 (responsive to high light) gene, that was rapidly upregulated in proportion to the time of irradiation and the light intensity. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing the rhl41 gene showed an increased tolerance to high-intensity light, and also morphological changes of thicker and dark green leaves. Interestingly, the palisade parenchyma was highly developed in the leaves of the transgenic plants, which is one of the long-term acclimatization responses in Arabidopsis plants. The anthocyanin content (a light protectant) as well as the chlorophyll content also increased. Antisense transgenic plants exhibited decreased tolerance to high irradiation. We propose that the RHL41 zinc finger protein has a key role in the acclimatization response to changes in light intensity.},

abstract = {The heterochronic genes lin-4, lin-14, lin-28, and lin-29 specify the timing of lateral hypodermal seam cell terminal differentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans. We devised a screen to identify additional genes involved in this developmental timing mechanism based on identification of mutants that exhibit temporal misexpression from the col-19 promoter, a downstream target of the heterochronic gene pathway. We fused the col-19 promoter to the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) and demonstrated that hypodermal expression of the fusion gene is adult-specific in wild-type animals and temporally regulated by the heterochronic gene pathway. We generated a transgenic strain in which the col-19::gfp fusion construct is not expressed because of mutation of lin-4 which prevents seam cell terminal differentiation. We have identified and characterized 26 mutations that restore col-19::gfp expression in the lin 4 mutant background. Most of the mutations also restore other aspects of the seam cell terminal differentiation program that are defective in lin-4 mutant animals. Twelve mutations are alleles of three previously identified genes known to be required for proper timing of hypodermal terminal differentiation. Among these are four new alleles of lin-42, a heterochronic gene for which a single allele had been described previously. Two mutations define a new gene, lin-58. When separated from lin-4, the lin-58 mutations cause precocious seam cell terminal differentiation and thus define a new member of the heterochronic gene pathway.},

abstract = {Development of the Caenorhabditis elegans vulva serves as a paradigm for intercellular signaling during animal development. In wild-type animals, the somatic gonadal anchor cell generates the LIN-3/EGF ligand to induce vulva[ fates in the underlying hypodermis, whereas FBF, FOG-1, and FOG-3 control germ-line development. Here we report that FBF functions redundantly with FOG-1 and FOG-3 to control vulval induction: animals lacking FBF and either FOG-1 or FOG-3 have multiple vulvae, the Muv phenotype. The fog; fbf Muv phenotype is generated by aberrant induction of vulval precursor cells (VPCs): in wild-type animals, three VPCs are induced to form a single vulva, but, in fog, fbf mutants, four or five VPCs are typically induced, resulting in ectopic vulvae. Laser ablation experiments and mosaic analyses demonstrate that the germ line is critical for the fog; fbf Muv phenotype. Consistent with that site of action, we detect FBF and FOG-1 in the germ line but not in the VPCs. The simplest interpretation is that FOG-1, FOG-3, and FBF act in the germ line to influence vulval fates. The LIN-3/EGF ligand may be the germ-line signal to the VPCs: the fog, fbf Muv phenotype depends on LIN-3 activity, and the lin-3 3' UTR possesses an FBF binding element. Our findings reveal new insights into germ line-to-soma signals and the role of PUF proteins in animal development.},

abstract = {SIRK is a K(+) channel identified in grapevine (Vitis vinifera), belonging to the so-called Shaker family. The highest sequence similarities it shares with the members of this family are found with channels of the KAT type, although SIRK displays a small ankyrin domain. This atypical feature provides a key to understand the evolution of the plant Shaker family. Expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes indicated that SIRK is an inwardly rectifying channel displaying functional properties very similar to those of KAT2. The activity of SIRK promoter region fused to the GUS reporter gene was analyzed in both grapevine and Arabidopsis. Like other KAT-like channels, SIRK is expressed in guard cells. In Arabidopsis, the construct is also expressed in xylem parenchyma. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments indicated that SIRK transcript was present at low levels in the berry, during the first stages of berry growth. After veraison, the period of berry development that corresponds to the inception of ripening and that is associated with large biochemical and structural modifications, such as evolution of stomata in nonfunctional lenticels and degeneration of xylem vasculature, the transcript was no longer detected. The whole set of data suggests that in the berries SIRK is expressed in guard cells and, possibly, in xylem tissues. The encoded channel polypeptide could therefore play a role in the regulation of transpiration and water fluxes in grapevine fruits.},

abstract = {Predators can affect the vertical distribution of mobile intertidal invertebrates in two ways: they can (1) cause greater mortality of prey at certain intertidal levels, and (2) induce prey to seek safer intertidal areas. In this study, we investigate whether low-intertidal and subtidal predators affect the intertidal distribution of two congeneric species of small herbivorous gastropods of northeastern Pacific shores, Littorina sitkana Philippi 1846, and L. scutulata Gould 1849. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that predators affect the distribution of these snails by inducing them to seek higher and safer intertidal areas. On a wave-sheltered shore in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, L. sitkana and L. scutulata were both killed by predatory crabs (e.g., Cancer productus) more frequently when tethered near the lower limit of their intertidal distribution (≈1 m) than when tethered where they were most common (≈2.5 m), suggesting that high mortality rates are partly responsible for the lower-limit of these snails’ intertidal distribution. However, two field mark-recapture experiments indicated that the snails’ behavioral response to predation risk also influences their distribution. In the first experiment, snails from the 2.5-m level (low risk) transplanted to the 1.0-m level (high risk) displayed a strong and consistent tendency to move shoreward, especially L. sitkana, some traveling 10–15 m in 2–3 days to regain their original level. These shoreward movements were especially precise in the northern part of the study area, where predation rates on tethered snails were greatest. Furthermore, larger more vulnerable snails were more strongly oriented shoreward than smaller individuals, indicating that antipredator behavior might also contribute to intertidal size gradients in these species. In the second mark-recapture experiment, we manipulated predation risk using small cages and found that snails exposed to the odors of C. productus crabs foraging on conspecific and heterospecific snails displayed more precise (L. sitkana and L. scutulata) and longer (L. sitkana) shoreward movements than snails held in control conditions. These results provide the first experimental evidence that antipredator behavior may contribute to the intertidal distribution patterns of littorinids.},

abstract = {Allelic expression differences contribute to phenotypic variation. In X chromosome inactivation (XCI), unfavorable XCI ratios promote X-linked disease penetrance in females. During XCI, one X is randomly silenced by Xist. X chromosome choice is determined by asymmetric expression of Tsix whose antisense action represses Xist. Here, we discover a cis element in the mouse X-inactivation center that regulates Tsix. Xite harbors intergenic transcription start sites and DNaseI hypersensitive sites with allelic differences. At the onset of XCI, deleting Xite downregulates Tsix in cis and skews XCI ratios, suggesting that Xite promotes Tsix persistence on the active X. Truncating Xite RNA is inconsequential, indicating that Xite action does not require intact transcripts. We propose that allele-specific Xite action promotes Tsix asymmetry and generates X chromosome inequality. Therefore, Xite is a candidate for the Xce, the classical modifier of XCI ratios.},

abstract = {Motivation: For the biologist, running bioinformatics analyses involves a time-consuming management of data and tools. Users need support to organize their work, retrieve parameters and reproduce their analyses. They also need to be able to combine their analytic tools using a safe data flow software mechanism. Finally, given that scientific tools can be difficult to install, it is particularly helpful for biologists to be able to use these tools through a web user interface. However, providing a web interface for a set of tools raises the problem that a single web portal cannot offer all the existing and possible services: it is the user, again, who has to cope with data copy among a number of different services. A framework enabling portal administrators to build a network of cooperating services would therefore clearly be beneficial. We have designed a system, Mobyle, to provide a flexible and usable Web environment for defining and running bioinformatics analyses. It embeds simple yet powerful data management features that allow the user to reproduce analyses and to combine tools using a hierarchical typing system. Mobyle offers invocation of services distributed over remote Mobyle servers, thus enabling a federated network of curated bioinformatics portals without the user having to learn complex concepts or to install sophisticated software. While being focused on the end user, the Mobyle system also addresses the need, for the bioinfomatician, to automate remote services execution: PlayMOBY is a companion tool that automates the publication of BioMOBY web services, using Mobyle program definitions. The Mobyle system is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPLv2 on the project web site (). It is already deployed on three servers: , and .

abstract = {Summary$\backslash$n          There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {To equalize X-chromosome dosages between the sexes, the female mammal inactivates one of her two X chromosomes. X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is initiated by expression of Xist, a 17-kb noncoding RNA (ncRNA) that accumulates on the X in cis. Because interacting factors have not been isolated, the mechanism by which Xist induces silencing remains unknown. We discovered a 1.6-kilobase ncRNA (RepA) within Xist and identified the Polycomb complex, PRC2, as its direct target. PRC2 is initially recruited to the X by RepA RNA, with Ezh2 serving as the RNA binding subunit. The antisense Tsix RNA inhibits this interaction. RepA depletion abolishes full-length Xist induction and trimethylation on lysine 27 of histone H3 of the X. Likewise, PRC2 deficiency compromises Xist up-regulation. Therefore, RepA, together with PRC2, is required for the initiation and spread of XCI. We conclude that a ncRNA cofactor recruits Polycomb complexes to their target locus.},

abstract = {Around the world, the human-induced collapses of populations and species have triggered a sixth mass extinction crisis, with rare species often being the first to disappear. Although the role of species diversity in the maintenance of ecosystem processes has been widely investigated, the role of rare species remains controversial. A critical issue is whether common species insure against the loss of functions supported by rare species. This issue is even more critical in species-rich ecosystems where high functional redundancy among species is likely and where it is thus often assumed that ecosystem functioning is buffered against species loss. Here, using extensive datasets of species occurrences and functional traits from three highly diverse ecosystems (846 coral reef fishes, 2,979 alpine plants, and 662 tropical trees), we demonstrate that the most distinct combinations of traits are supported predominantly by rare species both in terms of local abundance and regional occupancy. Moreover, species that have low functional redundancy and are likely to support the most vulnerable functions, with no other species carrying similar combinations of traits, are rarer than expected by chance in all three ecosystems. For instance, 63{\%} and 98{\%} of fish species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions in coral reef ecosystems are locally and regionally rare, respectively. For alpine plants, 32{\%} and 89{\%} of such species are locally and regionally rare, respectively. Remarkably, 47{\%} of fish species and 55{\%} of tropical tree species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions have only one individual per sample on average. Our results emphasize the importance of rare species conservation, even in highly diverse ecosystems, which are thought to exhibit high functional redundancy. Rare species offer more than aesthetic, cultural, or taxonomic diversity value; they disproportionately increase the potential breadth of functions provided by ecosystems across spatial scales. As such, they are likely to insure against future uncertainty arising from climate change and the ever-increasing anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems. Our results call for a more detailed understanding of the role of rarity and functional vulnerability in ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {This review contains a description of a research program for the study of maladaptation, defined here in terms of deviation from adaptive peaks. Maladaptation has many genetic causes, including mutation, inbreeding, drift, gene flow, heterozygote advantage and pleiotropy. Degrees of maladaptation are determined by genetic architecture and the relationship between the rates of selective, environmental change and the nature and extent of genetic responses to selection. The empirical analysis of maladaptation requires: (1) recognition of putative maladaptation, using methods from phylogenetics, teleonomy, development and genetics, followed by an assessment of the nature and degree of deviation from adaptation, using studies of natural selection and teleonomy; (2) determination of the causes of the deviation, using analyses of genetics, development, or other methods. Conditions for unambiguously identifying maladaptation are considerably more stringent than those for demonstrating adaptation and remarkably few studies have clearly identified and characterised maladaptative traits. A thorough understanding of the nature of phenotypic variation will never be achieved without an analysis of the scope and usual causes of maladaptation.},

abstract = {Choosing appropriate primers is probably the single most important factor affecting the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific amplification of the intended target requires that primers do not have matches to other targets in certain orientations and within certain distances that allow undesired amplification. The process of designing specific primers typically involves two stages. First, the primers flanking regions of interest are generated either manually or using software tools; then they are searched against an appropriate nucleotide sequence database using tools such as BLAST to examine the potential targets. However, the latter is not an easy process as one needs to examine many details between primers and targets, such as the number and the positions of matched bases, the primer orientations and distance between forward and reverse primers. The complexity of such analysis usually makes this a time-consuming and very difficult task for users, especially when the primers have a large number of hits. Furthermore, although the BLAST program has been widely used for primer target detection, it is in fact not an ideal tool for this purpose as BLAST is a local alignment algorithm and does not necessarily return complete match information over the entire primer range. Results We present a new software tool called Primer-BLAST to alleviate the difficulty in designing target-specific primers. This tool combines BLAST with a global alignment algorithm to ensure a full primer-target alignment and is sensitive enough to detect targets that have a significant number of mismatches to primers. Primer-BLAST allows users to design new target-specific primers in one step as well as to check the specificity of pre-existing primers. Primer-BLAST also supports placing primers based on exon/intron locations and excluding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in primers. Conclusions We describe a robust and fully implemented general purpose primer design tool that designs target-specific PCR primers. Primer-BLAST offers flexible options to adjust the specificity threshold and other primer properties. This tool is publicly available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast.},

abstract = {Structural changes (deletions, insertions, and inversions) between human and chimpanzee genomes have likely had a significant impact on lineage-specific evolution because of their potential for dramatic and irreversible mutation. The low-quality nature of the Current chimpanzee genome assembly precludes the reliable identification of many of these differences. To circumvent this, we applied a method to optimally map chimpanzee fosmid paired-end sequences against the human genome to systematically identify sites of structural variation >= 12 kb between the two species. Our analysis yielded a total of 651 putative sites of chimpanzee deletion (n = 293), insertions (n = 184), and rearrangements consistent with local inversions between the two genomes (n = 174). We validated a Subset (19/23) of insertion and deletions using PCR and Southern blot assays, confirming the accuracy of our method. The events are distributed throughout the genome on all chromosomes but are highly correlated with sites of segmental duplication in human and chimpanzee. These structural variants encompass at least 24 Mb of DNA and overlap with >245 genes. Seventeen of these genes contain exons missing in the chimpanzee genomic sequence and also show a significant reduction in gene expression in chimpanzee. Compared with the pioneering work of Yunis, Prakash, Dutrillaux, and Lejeune, this analysis expands the number of potential rearrangements between chimpanzees and humans 50-fold. Furthermore, this work prioritizes regions for further finishing in the chimpanzee genome and provides a resource for interrogating functional differences between humans and chimpanzees.},

We investigated (i) the role of blue light (BL) and CTK in anthocyanin accumulation ; and (ii) the relationship between BL and CTK in wild type (WT) and hy4 mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana. Two-d-old seedlings grown on medium with or without kinetin (KT) or zeatin (ZT) in darkness were irradiated using BL at different fluence rates for 3 d before the anthocyanin content was determined using a spectrophotometric method. Anthocyanin accumulation was strongly induced by BL in WT seedlings but not in hy4 seedlings, which demonstrated that CRY1 is the main photoreceptor for BL. Both KT and ZT enhanced the response of the WT seedlings to BL in a dose-dependent manner, whereas they were not sufficient to promote anthocyanin accumulation in darkness. In addition, data from experiments using the hy4 mutant showed that the CTK effect of BL was also CRY1-dependent. The results from experiments with three different treatment programs showed that the relationship between BL and KT in anthocyanin accumulation of Arabidopsis seedlings seems neither multiplicative nor additive coaction, but rather interaction. BL is necessary for anthocyanin accumulation, and KT might be involved in the BL signaling pathway.},

The most abundantly expressed isoform of this family, TPK1, is expressed at the tonoplast where it mediates K+ -selective currents between cytoplasmic and vacuolar compartments. TPK1 open probability depends on both cytoplasmic Ca2+ and cytoplasmic pH but not on the tonoplast membrane voltage. The channel shows intrinsic rectification and can be blocked by Ba2+, tetraethylammonium, and quinine. TPK1 current was found in all shoot cell types and shows all of the hallmarks of the previously described vacuolar K (VK) tonoplast channel characterized in guard cells. Characterization of TPK1 loss-of-function mutants and TPK1-overexpressing plants shows that TPK1 has a role in intracellular K+ homeostasis affecting seedling growth at high and low ambient K+ levels. In stomata, TPK1 function is consistent with vacuolar K+ release, and removal of this channel leads to slower stomatal closure kinetics. During germination, TPK1 contributes to the radicle development through vacuolar K+ deposition to provide expansion growth or in the redistribution of essential minerals.},

Here, we describe the different families of (putative) cation channels: the Shakers, the two-P-domain and Kir K+ channels (encoded by the KCO genes), the cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels, the glutamate receptors, and the Ca2+ channel TPC1. We also compare molecular data with the data obtained in planta, which should lead to a better understanding of the identity of these channels and provide clues about their roles in plant nutrition and cell signalling.},

abstract = {One of the most interesting aspects of plant fertilization is the growth and orientation of the pollen tube from the stigma to the ovary. Considerable research has been carried out in this field but little is yet known about the mechanisms involved in the growth process. Recent research has been focused on the regulation of molecular events in order to discover the specific genes involved in tube growth. Important results in the biochemical and physiological aspects of molecular regulation have been reported. The following review attempts to cover these aspects. It is primarily based on talks presented by the authors at the 13th International Congress on Sexual Plant Reproduction and is mainly addressed to non-experts in the fields of electrophysiology and ion signalling. We aim to present a general overview of electrical currents, ion dynamics, and ion transporters in pollen, and their possible role during pollen tube germination and growth. Together with results on other tip-growing cells, a general model of pollen tube germination and growth as a self-organizing process is proposed},

abstract = {Most K+ channels in plants are structurally classified into the Shaker family named after the shaker K+ channel in Drosophila. Plant K+ channels function in many physiological processes including osmotic regulation and K+ nutrition. An outwardly rectifying K+ channel, SKOR, mediates the delivery of K+ from stelar cells to the xylem in the roots, a critical step in the long-distance distribution of K+ from roots to the upper parts of the plant. Here we report that SKOR channel activity is strictly dependent on intracellular K+ concentrations. Activation by K+ did not affect the kinetics of voltage dependence in SKOR, indicating that a voltage-independent gating mechanism underlies the K+ sensing process. Further analysis showed that the C-terminal non-transmembrane region of the SKOR protein was required for this sensing process. The intracellular K+ sensing mechanism couples SKOR activity to K+ nutrition status in the 'source cells', thereby establishing a supply-based unloading system for the regulation of K+ distribution.},

Centred in North-West Europe, but using examples from all over the world, the book begins by considering the physical factors that characterize the habitat - primarily tides and waves - and goes on to assess how they influence the organisms that live within it. It describes how the behaviour and physiology of individuals belonging to the major groups - algae, grazers, suspension feeders, and predators - are affected by their habitat, how their communities are structured, and discusses theories of community organization. For field courses, it suggests experiments and observations that can be carried out on the shore or in nearbylaboratories. Finally, problems of pollution and conservation are considered in the context of their effects upon biodiversity.},

abstract = {Potassium (K+) homeostasis is essential for diverse cellular processes, although how various cation transporters collaborate to maintain a suitable K+ required for growth and development is poorly understood. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome contains numerous cation:proton antiporters (CHX), which may mediate K+ transport; however, the vast majority of these transporters remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that AtCHX13 (At2g30240) has a role in K+ acquisition. AtCHX13 suppressed the sensitivity of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant cells defective in K+ uptake. Uptake experiments using (86)Rb+ as a tracer for K+ demonstrated that AtCHX13 mediated high-affinity K+ uptake in yeast and in plant cells with a K(m) of 136 and 196 microm, respectively. Functional green fluorescent protein-tagged versions localized to the plasma membrane of both yeast and plant. Seedlings of null chx13 mutants were sensitive to K+ deficiency conditions, whereas overexpression of AtCHX13 reduced the sensitivity to K+ deficiency. Collectively, these results suggest that AtCHX13 mediates relatively high-affinity K+ uptake, although the mode of transport is unclear at present. AtCHX13 expression is induced in roots during K+-deficient conditions. These results indicate that one role of AtCHX13 is to promote K+ uptake into plants when K+ is limiting in the environment.},

abstract = {Mutations in the human NPC1 gene cause most cases of Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) disease, a fatal autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. NPC1 is implicated in intracellular trafficking of cholesterol and glycolipids, but its exact function remains unclear. The C. elegans genome contains two homologs of NPC1, ncr-1 and ncr-2, and an ncr-2; ncr-1 double deletion mutant forms dauer larvae constitutively (Daf-c). We have analyzed the phenotypes of ncr single and double mutants in detail, and determined the ncr gene expression patterns. We find that the ncr genes function in a hormonal branch of the dauer formation pathway upstream of daf-9 and daf-12, which encode a cytochrome P450 enzyme and a nuclear hormone receptor, respectively. ncr-1 is expressed broadly in tissues with high levels of cholesterol, whereas expression of ncr-2 is restricted to a few cells. Both Ncr genes are expressed in the XXX cells, which are implicated in regulating dauer formation via the daf-9 pathway. Only the ncr-1 mutant is hypersensitive to cholesterol deprivation and to progesterone, an inhibitor of intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Our results support the hypothesis that ncr-1 and ncr-2 are involved in intracellular cholesterol processing in C. elegans, and that a sterol-signaling defect is responsible for the Daf-c phenotype of the ncr-2; ncr-1 mutant.},

We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although >90{\%} of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. We observed 1.45 x 10(5) distinct splices, and alternative splices were prominent, with 3,500 different genes expressing one or more alternate internal splices.},

Northern geographical limits are set primarily by repopulation failure, and northern populations are characterised by short, mid-summer breeding periods, high frequency of failed or poor recruitments and low density of large, long-lived individuals. Towards the south molluscan breeding periods lengthen and become later, extending in some cases throughout much of the year but with least or no activity in mid-summer. There are probably fewer recruitment failures and thus higher densities, but individuals are of smaller maximum size and shorter life-span. The cirripedes show similar latitudinal trends in recruitment timing but Semibalanus is restricted to a sin- gle annual brood throughout its range. The two species reaching their southern limits show progressive restriction to the lowest tidal levels. Recruitment failures do not result from inadequate gonad activity. They arise in cirripedes during the planktonic phase and in the molluscs during settlement and early shore life. The temperature sensitivity of molluscan spat is primarily responsible for the north/south gradient in recruitment times from summer to- wards winter.},

abstract = {Socio-ecological models aim to predict the variation in social systems based on a limited number of ecological parameters. Since the 1960s, the original model has taken two paths: one relating to grouping patterns and mating systems and one relating to grouping patterns and female social structure. Here, we review the basic ideas specifically with regard to non-human primates, present new results and point to open questions. While most primates live in permanent groups and exhibit female defence polygyny, recent studies indicate more flexibility with cooperative male resource defence occurring repeatedly in all radiations. In contrast to other animals, the potential link between ecology and these mating systems remains, however, largely unexplored. The model of the ecology of female social structure has often been deemed successful, but has recently been criticized. We show that the predicted association of agonistic rates and despotism (directional consistency of relationships) was not supported in a comparative test. The overall variation in despotism is probably due to phylogenetic grade shifts. At the same time, it varies within clades more or less in the direction predicted by the model. This suggests that the model's utility may lie in predicting social variation within but not across clades.},

abstract = {An organism's ability to persist on wave-swept rocky shores is determined, in part, by its ability to resist dislodgement by waves. Resistance to dislodgement depends on hydrodynamic forces and on the ability of an organism to resist those forces by adhering to the substratum. In intertidal snails the structure upon which waves act is the shell and the structure that adheres is the muscular foot. We quantified: (1) shell size (defined as the maximum projected surface area, MPSA); (2) shell shape; (3) foot area; (4) maximum force to dislodge a snail in shear; and (5) tenacity (force per foot area required to dislodge) of the herbivorous intertidal snail Littorina obtusata. We compared individuals that were collected from habitats characterized by differences in exposure to waves. Wave-exposed snails were smaller (lower average MPSA). In addition, snails at the wave-exposed site were shorter, and had larger foot area and greater dislodgement force than did protected snails of similar MPSA. The greater dislodgement force at the exposed site was due to larger foot area, not to greater tenacity. In fact, size-specific tenacity of snails from the protected habitat was greater. Within each site, shape changed with size. Although shell width, length and MPSA scaled isometrically, shell height did not; longer shells were relatively short. Nor did foot area scale isometrically with MPSA; larger snails had relatively smaller foot areas. Assuming that MPSA is directly proportional to speed-specific drag, which is reasonable for bluff bodies, we found that dislodgement force was proportional to drag. This result suggests that increasing tenacity compensated for underscaling of foot area. In fact tenacity did increase with foot area, although only significantly so at the wave-exposed site.},

abstract = {Patterns of methylation of CpG dinucleotides in the promoter region of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene in wild-type and TK-deficient Chinese hamster cell lines were studied. Whereas wild-type cells were unmethylated, three conventionally derived TK-deficient cell lines were all almost completely methylated in the promoter region. Demethylation at a number of different CpG sites was observed upon selection for reexpression of the TK gene. Of thirteen Hhal (GCGC) or Hpall (CCGG) sites studied, the highest correlation between absence of methylation and at least partial TK activity was obtained at one Hhal site within 20 bp of the putative cap site. Silencing in the three conventionally derived mutants is therefore accompanied by hypermethylation of the promoter-associated CpG-rich island. We contrast this situation with another type of silencing event, in which TK was coordinately inactivated at a high frequency with at least one other linked allele. Methylation of the promoter region of TK was not associated with this event, but two lines of evidence suggested a role for methylation at sites other than in the promoter region of TK .},

To estimate an upper bound on the sensitivity of early morphogenetic movements to tissue mechanical properties, we assessed natural variability in the apparent stiffness among gastrula-stage Xenopus laevis embryos. We adapted micro-aspiration methods to make repeated, nondestructive measurements of apparent tissue stiffness in whole embryos. Stiffness varied by close to a factor of 2 among embryos within a single clutch. Variation between clutches was of similar magnitude. On the other hand, the direction of change in stiffness over the course of gastrulation was the same in all embryos and in all clutches. Neither pH nor salinity-two environmental factors we predicted could affect variability in nature affected tissue stiffness. Our results indicate that gastrulation in X. laevis is robust to at least twofold variation in tissue stiffness. Developmental Dynamics 238:2-18, 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

To determine the role of potassium channels in planta, we performed a reverse genetic screen and identified an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant in which the AKT1 channel gene was disrupted. Roots of this mutant lacked inward-rectifying potassium channels and displayed reduced potassium (rubidium-86) uptake. Compared with wild type, mutant plants grew poorly on media with a potassium concentration of 100 micromolar or less. These results and membrane potential measurements suggest that the AKT1 channel mediates potassium uptake from solutions that contain as little as 10 micromolar potassium.},

abstract = {Shaker-type K(+) channels in plants display distinct voltage-sensing properties despite sharing sequence and structural similarity. For example, an Arabidopsis K(+) channel (SKOR) and a tomato K(+) channel (LKT1) share high amino acid sequence similarity and identical domain structures; however, SKOR conducts outward K(+) current and is activated by positive membrane potentials (depolarization), whereas LKT1 conducts inward current and is activated by negative membrane potentials (hyperpolarization). The structural basis for the "opposite" voltage-sensing properties of SKOR and LKT1 remains unknown. Using a screening procedure combined with random mutagenesis, we identified in the SKOR channel single amino acid mutations that converted an outward-conducting channel into an inward-conducting channel. Further domain-swapping and random mutagenesis produced similar results, suggesting functional interactions between several regions of SKOR protein that lead to specific voltage-sensing properties. Dramatic changes in rectifying properties can be caused by single amino acid mutations, providing evidence that the inward and outward channels in the Shaker family from plants may derive from the same ancestor.},

Eudiaptomus spp. fed in varying concentrations of algae and polystyrene spheres, high-quality algae of different sizes, toxic and nontoxic algae, digestible and digestion-resistant algae, live and dead algae, and dead algae with and without attached bacteria. Experiments with polystyrene spheres showed that the rejection of nonfood particles did not intefere with feeding on relatively scarce algae. Particle selection in mixtures of algae exhibited good agreement with predictions of optimal foraging theory. Selectivity did not change with food concentration for mixtures of high-quality algae of mixtures of toxic and nontoxic algae. Copepods showed a weak but consistent preference for the larger of a pair of high-quality algae, whereas a toxic blue-green bacterium was eaten at a very low rate whether offered alone or in combination with an edible alga. Selection against low-quality nontoxic particles (e.g. digestion-resistant algae), however, was sensitive to food concentration. Discrimination against low-quality particles was strong when high-quality food was abundant and weak when high-quality food was scarce. In agreement with theory, diet selection by Eudiaptomus spp. is strongly influenced by both particle quality and the abundance of alternative foods.},

To test whether the guard cell K(+) channel KAT1 is essential for stomatal opening, a knockout mutant, KAT1En-1, was isolated from an En-1 mutagenized Arabidopsis thaliana population. Stomatal action and K(+) uptake, however, were not impaired in KAT1-deficient plants. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments with isolated guard cell protoplasts showed that in addition to KAT1, the K(+) channels AKT1, AKT2/3, AtKC1, and KAT2 were expressed in this cell type. In impalement measurements, intact guard cells exhibited inward-rectifying K(+) currents across the plasma membrane of both wild-type and KAT1En-1 plants. This study demonstrates that multiple K(+) channel transcripts exist in guard cells and that KAT1 is not essential for stomatal action.},

abstract = {Although gene duplication has generally been viewed as a necessary source of material for the origin of evolutionary novelties, the rates of origin, loss, and preservation of gene duplicates are not well understood. Applying steady-state demographic techniques to the age distributions of duplicate genes censused in seven completely sequenced genomes, we estimate the average rate of duplication of a eukaryotic gene to be on the order of 0.01/gene/million years, which is of the same order of magnitude as the mutation rate per nucleotide site. However, the average half-life of duplicate genes is relatively small, on the order of 4.0 million years. Significant interspecific variation in these rates appears to be responsible for differences in species-specific genome sizes that arise as a consequence of a quasi-equilibrium birth-death process. Most duplicated genes experience a brief period of relaxed selection early in their history and a minority exhibit the signature of directional selection, but those that survive more than a few million years eventually experience strong purifying selection. Thus, although most theoretical work on the gene-duplication process has focused on issues related to adaptive evolution, the origin of a new function appears to be a very rare fate for a duplicate gene. A more significant role of the duplication process may be the generation of microchromosomal rearrangements through reciprocal silencing of alternative copies, which can lead to the passive origin of post-zygotic reproductive barriers in descendant lineages of incipient species.},

Post-transcriptional control through the action of iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) and IRP2 coordinate the use of messenger RNA-encoding proteins that are involved in the uptake, storage, and use of iron in all cells of the body. IRPs may also provide a link between iron availability and cellular citrate use. Multiple factors, including iron, nitric oxide, oxidative stress, phosphorylation, and hypoxia/reoxygenation, influence IRP function. Recent evidence indicates that there is diversity in the function of the IRP system with respect to the response of specific IRPs to the same effector, as well as the selectivity with which IRPs modulate the use of specific messenger RNA.},

abstract = {Adaptive gender expression in simultaneous hermaphrodites will reflect the relative costs and benefits of each sexual function. The net gain through either or both functions may vary with body size. Shell length measurements ofPhysa gyrinaandP. heterostrophain the laboratory andP. heterostrophain the field revealed that successful mating generally involved smaller sperm donors and larger recipients. In contrast, attempts by larger snails to donate sperm were contested by smaller snails. These data suggest substantial plasticity in gender expression in accordance with a game-theoretic extension of Ghiselin's (1969,Q. Rev. Biol.,44,189-208, 1974;The Economy of Nature and the Evolution of Sex) size-advantage model. Specifically, the larger of two interacting snails is more fecund, so the smaller snail has more to gain by donating sperm. This asymmetry creates a contest in which the smaller snail can afford to escalate the contest more and still profit, so long as escalation costs are not greater for the smaller snail. In the present study, the usual form of contest escalation was a visually obvious shell-swinging display, which attracts predators. Thus, the smaller of two contestants can use the risk of predation as a weapon in contest escalations (i.e. a game of chicken), rather than using a purely physical contest that might favour the larger contestant.},

abstract = {The Arabidopsis thaliana K+ channel family of AtTPK/KCO proteins consists of six members including a 'single-pore' (Kir-type) and five 'tandem-pore' channels. AtTPK4 is currently the only ion channel of this family for which a function has been demonstrated in planta. The protein is located at the plasma membrane forming a voltage-independent K+ channel that is blocked by extracellular calcium ions. In contrast, AtTPK1 is a tonoplast-localized protein, that establishes a K+-selective, voltage-independent ion channel activated by cytosolic calcium when expressed in a heterologous system, i.e. yeast. Here, we provide evidence that other AtTPK/KCO channel subunits, i.e. AtTPK2, AtTPK3, AtTPK5 and AtKCO3, are also targeted to the vacuolar membrane, opening the possibility that they interact at the target membrane to form heteromeric ion channels. However, when testing the cellular expression patterns of AtTPK/KCO genes we observed distinct expression domains that overlap in only a few tissues of the Arabidopsis plant, making it unlikely that different channel subunits interact to form heteromeric channels. This conclusion was substantiated by in planta expression of combinations of selected tonoplast AtTPK/KCO proteins. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays indicate that protein interaction occurs between identical channel subunits (most efficiently between AtTPK1 or AtKCO3) but not between different channel subunits. The finding could be confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. We conclude that tonoplast-located AtTPK/KCO subunits form homomeric ion channels in vivo.},

In this paper, the expression pattern of the gene encoding AKT1 is described. Northern blots indicate that AKT1 transcripts are preferentially accumulated in Arabidopsis roots. Owing to the difficulties in producing large quantities of Arabidopsis roots under hydroponic conditions, experiments were undertaken with Brassica napus, a related species. Potassium starvation experiments on B. napus plants show that changes in the K+ status of the organs do not modify AKT1 mRNA accumulation. Western blot analysis of B. napus proteins confirms the presence of AKT1 at the root plasma membrane. Tissue-specific expression directed by the Arabidopsis AKT1 gene promoter was investigated by analysis of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in transgenic Arabidopsis containing an AKT1-GUS gene fusion. As determined by fluorimetric and histochemical tests, the AKT1 promoter directs preferential expression in the peripheral cell layers of root mature regions. The discrete activity found in leaves relates to leaf primordia and to small groups of cells, hydathodes, found on toothed margins of the Arabidopsis leaf lamina. These data are discussed with regard to a possible role of AKT1 in K+ nutrition of plants.},

abstract = {Potassium (K+) is a major nutrient for plant growth and development. Vacuolar K+ ion channels of the two-pore K+ (TPK) family play an important role in maintaining K+ homeostasis. Several TPK channels were previously shown to be expressed in the lytic vacuole (LV) tonoplast. Plants also contain smaller protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) that contain membrane transporters. However, the mechanisms that define how membrane proteins reach different vacuolar destinations are largely unknown. The Oryza sativa genome encodes two TPK isoforms (TPKa and TPKb) that have very similar sequences and are ubiquitously expressed. The electrophysiological properties of both TPKs were comparable, showing inward rectification and voltage independence. In spite of high levels of similarity in sequence and transport properties, the cellular localization of TPKa and TPKb channels was different, with TPKa localization predominantly at the large LV and TPKb primarily in smaller PSV-type compartments. Trafficking of TPKa was sensitive to brefeldin A, while that of TPKb was not. The use of TPKa:TPKb chimeras showed that C-terminal domains are crucial for the differential targeting of TPKa and TPKb. Site-directed mutagenesis of C-terminal residues that were different between TPKa and TPKb identified three amino acids that are important in determining ultimate vacuolar destination.},

abstract = {Male fertility depends on the proper development of the male gametophyte, successful pollen germination, tube growth, and delivery of the sperm cells to the ovule. Previous studies have shown that nutrients like boron, and ion gradients or currents of Ca2+, H+, and K+ are critical for pollen tube growth. However, the molecular identities of transporters mediating these fluxes are mostly unknown. As a first step to integrate transport with pollen development and function, a genome-wide analysis of transporter genes expressed in the male gametophyte at four developmental stages was conducted. Approximately 1,269 genes encoding classified transporters were collected from the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome. Of 757 transporter genes expressed in pollen, 16{\%} or 124 genes, including AHA6, CNGC18, TIP1.3, and CHX08, are specifically or preferentially expressed relative to sporophytic tissues. Some genes are highly expressed in microspores and bicellular pollen (COPT3, STP2, OPT9), while others are activated only in tricellular or mature pollen (STP11, LHT7). Analyses of entire gene families showed that a subset of genes, including those expressed in sporophytic tissues, was developmentally regulated during pollen maturation. Early and late expression patterns revealed by transcriptome analysis are supported by promoter::beta-glucuronidase analyses of CHX genes and by other methods. Recent genetic studies based on a few transporters, including plasma membrane H+ pump AHA3, Ca2+ pump ACA9, and K+ channel SPIK, further support the expression patterns and the inferred functions revealed by our analyses. Thus, revealing the distinct expression patterns of specific transporters and unknown polytopic proteins during microgametogenesis provides new insights for strategic mutant analyses necessary to integrate the roles of transporters and potential receptors with male gametophyte development.},

abstract = {Caesium (Cs(+)) is a potentially toxic mineral element that is released into the environment and taken up by plants. Although Cs(+) is chemically similar to potassium (K(+)), and much is known about K(+) transport mechanisms, it is not clear through which K(+) transport mechanisms Cs(+) is taken up by plant roots. In this study, the role of AtHAK5 in high affinity K(+) and Cs(+) uptake was characterized. It is demonstrated that AtHAK5 is localized to the plasma membrane under conditions of K(+) deprivation, when it is expressed. Growth analysis showed that AtHAK5 plays a role during severe K(+) deprivation. Under K(+)-deficient conditions in the presence of Cs(+), Arabidopsis seedlings lacking AtHAK5 had increased inhibition of root growth and lower Cs(+) accumulation, and significantly higher leaf chlorophyll concentrations than wild type. These data indicate that, in addition to transporting K(+) in planta, AtHAK5 also transports Cs(+). Further experiments showed that AtHAK5 mediated Cs(+) uptake into yeast cells and that, although the K(+) deficiency-induced expression of AtHAK5 was inhibited by low concentrations of NH(4)(+) in planta, Cs(+) uptake by yeast was stimulated by low concentrations of NH(4)(+). Interestingly, the growth of the Arabidopsis atakt1-1 mutant was more sensitive to Cs(+) than the wild type. This may be explained, in part, by increased expression of AtHAK5 in the atakt1-1 mutant. It is concluded that AtHAK5 is a root plasma membrane uptake mechanism for K(+) and Cs(+) under conditions of low K(+) availability.},

The mRNA sequences in this fraction were mapped between 51.7 and 61.3 units on the genome by visualizing RNA· DNA hybrids in the electron microscope. When hybrids of hexon mRNA and single-stranded restriction endonuclease cleavage fragments of viral DNA were visualized in the electron microscope, branched forms were observed in which 160 nucleotides of RNA from the 5 ′ terminus were not hydrogen bonded to the single-stranded DNA. DNA sequences complementary to the RNA sequences in each 5 ′ tail were found by electron microscopy to be located at 17, 20, and 27 units on the same strand as that coding for the body of the hexon mRNA. Thus, four segments of viral RNA may be joined together during the synthesis of mature hexon mRNA. A model is presented for adenovirus late mRNA synthesis that involves multiple splicing during maturation of a larger precursor nuclear RNA.},

Thus far, a total of 21 clones of rbcL genes derived from mRNA have been obtained and completely sequenced from the Ballast Island site, For surface water samples, deduced amino acid sequences of five of six clones appeared to be representative of green algae, In contrast, six of nine sequenced rbcL clones from 10-m-deep samples were of chromophytic and rhodophytic lineages, At 5 m deep, the active CO2-fixing planktonic organisms represented a diverse group, including organisms related to Chlorella ellipsoidea, Cylindrotheca sp. strain N1, and Olisthodiscus luteus. Although many more samplings at diverse sites must be accomplished, the discovery of distinctly different sequences of rbcL mRNA at different water depths suggests that there is a stratification of active CO2-fixing organisms in western Lake Erie.},

abstract = {14-3-3 proteins modulate the plant inward rectifier K+ channel KAT1 heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Injection of recombinant plant 14-3-3 proteins into oocytes shifted the activation curve of KAT1 by +11 mV and increased the tau(on). KAT1 was also modulated by 14-3-3 proteins of Xenopus oocytes. Titration of the endogenous 14-3-3 proteins by injection of the peptide Raf 621p resulted in a strong decrease in KAT1 current (approximately 70{\%} at -150 mV). The mutation K56E performed on plant protein 14-3-3 in a highly conserved recognition site prevented channel activation. Because the maximal conductance of KAT1 was unaffected by 14-3-3, we can exclude that they act by increasing the number of channels, thus ruling out any effect of these proteins on channel trafficking and/or insertion into the oocyte membrane. 14-3-3 proteins also increased KAT1 current in inside-out patches, suggesting a direct interaction with the channel. Direct interaction was confirmed by overlay experiments with radioactive 14-3-3 on oocyte membranes expressing KAT1.},

abstract = {1. In neutral aqueous solution N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) yields salts of nitrocyanamide as u.v.-absorbing products. With cysteine, as found independently by Schulz {\&} McCalla (1969), the principal product is 2-nitr{\`{a}}minothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid. Both these reactions liberate the methylating species; thiols enhance the rate markedly at neutral pH values. An alternative reaction with thiols gives cystine, presumably via the unstable S-nitrosocysteine. 2. Thiols (glutathione or N-acetylcysteine) in vitro at about the concentration found in mammalian cells enhance the rate of methylation of DNA markedly over that in neutral solution. 3. Treatment of cultured mammalian cells with MNNG results in rapid methylation of nucleic acids, the extent being greater the higher the thiol content of the cells. Rodent embryo cells are more extensively methylated than mouse L-cells of the same thiol content. Cellular thiol concentrations are decreased by MNNG. Proteins are less methylated by MNNG than are nucleic acids. 4. Methylation of cells by dimethyl sulphate does not depend on cellular thiol content and protein is not less methylated than nucleic acids. Methylation by MNNG may therefore be thiol-stimulated in cells. 5. Both in vitro and in cells about 7{\%} of the methylation of DNA by MNNG occurs at the 6-oxygen atom of guanine. The major products 7-methylguanine and 3-methyladenine are given by both MNNG and dimethyl sulphate, but dimethyl sulphate does not yield O(6)-methylguanine. Possible reaction mechanisms to account for this difference between these methylating agents and its possible significance as a determinant of their biological effects are discussed.},

Ion transport and the plasma membrane transporters themselves have been studied using a variety of techniques. In the last 15 years, measurement of specific ion fluxes has contributed to the characterization of transport systems. Progress in molecular genetics is allowing gene identification and controlled expression of transporter molecules. However the molecular expression of transporter gene products must be characterized at the functional level. The ion-selective microelectrode technique to measure specific ion fluxes non-invasively is ideally suited to this purpose. This technique, its theory, its links with others and its application and prospects in plant science, are discussed. Ions studied include hydrogen, potassium, sodium, ammonium, calcium, chloride and nitrate. Applications discussed include: solute ion uptake by roots; gravitropism and other processes in the root cap, meristematic and elongation zones; Nod factor effect on root hairs; osmotic and salt stresses; oscillations; the effects of light and temperature. Studies have included intact roots, leaf mesophyll and other tissues, protoplasts and bacterial biofilms. A multi-ion capability of the technique will greatly assist functional genomics, particularly when coupled with imaging techniques, patch clamping and the use of suitable mutants.},

The ability to tether two distinct complexes enables RNA-mediated assembly of PRC2 and LSD1 and coordinates targeting of PRC2 and LSD1 to chromatin for coupled histone H3 lysine 27 methylation and lysine 4 demethylation. Our results suggest that lincRNAs may serve as scaffolds by providing binding surfaces to assemble select histone modification enzymes, thereby specifying the pattern of histone modifications on target genes.},

abstract = {In Caenorhabditis elegans, the terminal differentiation of the hypodermal cells occurs at the larval-to-adult molt, and is characterized ill part by the formation of a morphologically distinct adult cuticle, The timing of this event is controlled by a pathway of heterochronic genes that includes the relatively direct regulatory gene, lin-29, and upstream genes lin-4, lin-14 and lin-28. Using northern analysis to detect endogenous collagen mRNA levels and collagen/lacZ reporter constructs to monitor collagen transcriptional activity, we show that the stage-specific switch from larval cuticle to adult cuticle correlates with the transcriptional activation of adult-specific collagen genes and repression of larval-specific collagen genes, Heterochronic mutations that cause precocious formation of adult cuticle also cause precocious transcription of the adult-specific collagen genes, col-7 and col-19; heterochronic mutations that prevent the switch to adult cuticle cause continued expression of the larval collagen gene, col-17, in adults and prevent adult-specific activation of col-7 or col-19. A 235 bp segment of col-19 5' sequences is sufficient to direct the adult-specific expression of a col-19/lacZ reporter gene in hypodermal cells, These findings indicate that the heterochronic gene pathway regulates the timing of hypodermal cell terminal differentiation by regulating larval- and adult-specific gene expression, perhaps by the direct action of lin-29.},

abstract = {Anthocyanin pigmentation in leaves, flowers, and fruit imparts violet to black color and enhances both ornamental and culinary appeal. Shades of violet to black pigmentation in Capsicum annuum L. are attributed to anthocyanin accumulation. Anthocyanin production is markedly influenced by numerous environmental factors, including temperature and light stress. The objective of this study was to determine the genetic basis for differences in C. annuum anthocyanin content in response to varying environments. Growth experiments conducted under controlled environment conditions demonstrated that anthocyanin concentration was significantly higher in mature leaves in comparison with immature leaves under high light (435 mu mol.s(-1).m(-2)) conditions. High (30 degrees C day/25 degrees C night) versus low (20 degrees C day/15 degrees C night) temperature had no significant effect on anthocyanin concentration regardless of leaf maturity stage. Foliar anthocyanin concentration in plants grown under short days (10 h) with low light intensity (215 mu mol.s(-1).m(-2)) was significantly less than under long days (16 h) with low light. Under high light intensity, daylength had no effect on anthocyanin content. Three structural genes [chalcone synthase (Chs), dihydroflavonol reductase (Dfr), anthocyanin synthase (Ans)] and three regulatory genes (Myc, Myb(A), Wd40) were selected for comparison under inductive and noninductive environmental conditions for anthocyanin accumulation. Expression of Chs, Dfr, and Ans was significantly higher in mature leaves in comparison with younger leaves. Consistent with anthocyanin concentration, temperature had no effect on structural gene expression, whereas light positively influenced expression. Under low light conditions, temperature had no effect on Myc, Myb(A), and Wd40 expression; whereas under high light conditions, temperature only had an effect on Myb(A) expression. The study of anthocyanin leaf pigmentation in C. annuum under inductive and noninductive environments provides a new approach for elucidating the molecular genetic basis of epistatic gene interactions and the resulting phenotypic plasticity.},

In this review, some of the themes and topics that have emerged from such analyses are briefly discussed to provide an up-date for practitioners and ecologists working in other habitats. Conceptual issues include the widespread occurrence of transphyletic use of the same resources (space and food), theories and experimental analyses of intermediate disturbance in relation to numbers of species, the complex but pervasive nature of indirect interactions among species, relative importance of 'top-down' versus 'bottom-up' control of assemblages and the importance to rocky intertidal species of 'supply-side' influences on densities and interactions. Methodological advances include experimental designs for complex and patchy, interacting sets of species, the importance of controls in experimental manipulations and methods for analyses of hierarchical scales of patterns and processes. Finally, some contributions to social issues (pollution, biodiversity) and some scenarios for future directions are briefly considered. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Flavonoids are synthesized through an important metabolic pathway that leads to the production of diverse secondary metabolites, including anthocyanins, flavonols, flavones, and proanthocyanidins. Anthocyanins and flavonols are derived from Phe and share common precursors, dihydroflavonols, which are substrates for both flavonol synthase and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase. In the stems of Arabidopsis thaliana, anthocyanins accumulate in an acropetal manner, with the highest level at the junction between rosette and stem. We show here that this accumulation pattern is under the regulation of miR156-targeted SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) genes, which are deeply conserved and known to have important roles in regulating phase change and flowering. Increased miR156 activity promotes accumulation of anthocyanins, whereas reduced miR156 activity results in high levels of flavonols. We further provide evidence that at least one of the miR156 targets, SPL9, negatively regulates anthocyanin accumulation by directly preventing expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes through destabilization of a MYB-bHLH-WD40 transcriptional activation complex. Our results reveal a direct link between the transition to flowering and secondary metabolism and provide a potential target for manipulation of anthocyanin and flavonol content in plants.},

abstract = {Pollen tube growth requires a Ca2+ gradient, with elevated levels of cytosolic Ca2+ at the growing tip. This gradient's magnitude oscillates with growth oscillation but is always maintained. Ca2+ influx into the growing tip is necessary, and its magnitude also oscillates with growth. It has been widely assumed that stretch-activated Ca2+ channels underlie this influx, but such channels have never been reported in either pollen grains or pollen tubes. We have identified and characterized stretch-activated Ca2+ channels from Lilium longiflorum pollen grain and tube tip protoplasts. The channels were localized to a small region of the grain protoplasts associated with the site of tube germination. In addition, we find a stretch-activated K+ channel as well as a spontaneous K+ channel distributed over the entire grain surface, but neither was present at the germination site or at the tip. Neither stretch-activated channel was detected in the grain protoplasts unless the grains were left in germination medium for at least 1 h before protoplast preparation. The stretch-activated channels were inhibited by a spider venom that is known to block stretch-activated channels in animal cells, but the spontaneous channel was unaffected by the venom. The venom also stopped pollen tube germination and elongation and blocked Ca2+ entry into the growing tip, suggesting that channel function is necessary for growth.},

abstract = {The main function of antibiotics is related to their capacity to eliminate a microorganism. In addition to the antimicrobial function of antibiotics, they are known to have anti-inflammatory and vasomodulatory effects on the microcirculation. The ability of non-antimicrobial derivatives of antibiotics to control inflammation illustrates the distinct anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory roles of antibiotics. In this review, we discuss the impact of antibiotics on leukocyte recruitment and the state of the microcirculation. Literature reporting the effect of antibiotics in non-infectious inflammatory conditions is reviewed as well as the studies demonstrating the anti-inflammatory effects of antibiotics in animal models of infection. In addition, the effect of the antibiotics on the immune system is summarized in this review, in order to postulate some mechanisms of action for the pro-and anti-inflammatory contribution of antibiotics. Literature reported the effect of antibiotics on the production of cytokines, chemotaxis and recruitment of leukocytes, production of reactive oxygen species, process of phagocytosis and autophagy, and apoptosis of leukocytes. Yet, all antibiotics may not necessarily exert an anti-inflammatory effect on the microcirculation. Thus, we suggest a model for spectrum of anti-inflammatory and vasomodulatory effects of antibiotics in the microcirculation of animals in local and systemic inflammation. Although the literature suggests the ability of antibiotics to modulate leukocyte recruitment and microperfusion, the process and the mechanism of action are not fully characterized. Studying this process will expand the knowledge base that is required for the selection of antibiotic treatment based on its anti-inflammatory functions, which might be particularly important for critically ill patients.},

abstract = {Potassium (K+) channels mediating important physiological functions are characterized by a common pore-forming (P) domain. We report the cloning and functional analysis of the first higher plant outward rectifying K+ channel (KCO1) from Arabidopsis thaliana. KCO1 belongs to a new class of 'two-pore' K+ channels recently described in human and yeast. KCO1 has four putative transmembrane segments and tandem calcium-binding EF-hand motifs. Heterologous expression of KCO1 in baculovirus-infected insect (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells resulted in outwardly rectifying, K+-selective currents elicited by depolarizing voltage pulses in whole-cell measurements. Activation of KCO1 was strongly dependent on the presence of nanomolar concentrations of cytosolic free Ca2+ [Ca2+]cyt. No K+ currents were detected when [Ca2+]cyt was adjusted to <150 nM. However, KCO1 strongly activated at increasing [Ca2+]cyt, with a saturating activity observed at approximately 300 nM [Ca2+]cyt. KCO1 single channel analysis on excised membrane patches, resulting in a single channel conductance of 64 pS, confirmed outward rectification as well as Ca2+-dependent activation. These data suggest a direct link between calcium-mediated signaling processes and K+ ion transport in higher plants. The identification of KCO1 as the first plant K+ outward channel opens a new field of structure-function studies in plant ion channels.},

The location of the T-DNA inserts, the expression of the flanking genes, and the promoter activity of the genomic DNA upstream of the T-DNA were characterized. The results indicated that the GFP expression pattern in at least one of the lines was due to elements in the intergenic DNA immediately upstream of the T-DNA, rather than due to the activity of the promoters of genes flanking the insert, and provide evidence for the involvement of Dof elements in regulating guard cell gene expression. It is shown further that the GAL4 GFP lines can be used to track the contribution of guard cell material in vitro, and this method was used to assess the purity of guard cell samples obtained using two methods of guard cell isolation.},

abstract = {An inward Shaker K(+) channel identified in Zea mays (maize), ZmK2.1, displays strong regulation by external K(+) when expressed in Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog) oocytes or COS cells. ZmK2.1 is specifically activated by K(+) with an apparent K(m) close to 15 mM independent of the membrane hyperpolarization level. In the absence of K(+), ZmK2.1 appears to enter a nonconducting state. Thus, whatever the membrane potential, this maize channel cannot mediate K(+) influx in the submillimolar concentration range, unlike its relatives in Arabidopsis thaliana. Its expression is restricted to the shoots, the strongest signal (RT-PCR) being associated with vascular/bundle sheath strands. Based on sequence and gene structure, the closest relatives of ZmK2.1 in Arabidopsis are K(+) Arabidopsis Transporter 1 (KAT1) (expressed in guard cells) and KAT2 (expressed in guard cells and leaf phloem). Patch-clamp analyses of guard cell protoplasts reveal a higher functional diversity of K(+) channels in maize than in Arabidopsis. Channels endowed with regulation by external K(+) similar to that of ZmK2.1 (channel activity regulated by external K(+) with a K(m) close to 15 mM, regulation independent of external Ca(2+)) constitute a major component of the maize guard cell inward K(+) channel population. The presence of such channels in maize might reflect physiological traits of C4 and/or monocotyledonous plants.},

Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA exhibited an inward-rectifying K+ current, demonstrating that the AKT3 polypeptide is a functional transport protein.

abstract = {We report here on the transcriptional activity of multiple copies of a subtelomerically located olfactory receptor (OR) gene, OR-A. Due to recent duplication events, both the copy number and chromosomal location of OR-A vary among humans. Sequence analyses of 180 copies of this gene, derived from 12 chromosome ends in 22 individuals, show that the main coding exon of all but one copy is an intact open reading frame with 0-5 predicted amino acid differences. We detected transcription of OR-A in both olfactory epithelium and testis tissue using RT-PCR amplification with primers designed on the basis of a computationally predicted gene structure. Two alternatively spliced forms of transcripts, one encoding an isoform with an extended N-terminus, were found in both tissues. A third transcript, derived from a second promoter, was also observed in testes. The start methionine is predicted in all transcripts to lie in an upstream exon rather than the main coding exon, as is typical for most other OR genes. By examining sequence variants among transcripts, we show that transcription of this gene occurs at multiple chromosomal locations. Our results lend credence to the idea that OR diversity could be generated in rearrangement-prone subtelomeric regions and show that polymorphism in subtelomeric regions could lead to individual-to-individual variation in the expressed repertoire of OR genes.},

abstract = {The iron content of serum ferritin has been determined in groups of patients with normal or increased iron stores by using a technique of ferritin immunoprecipitation followed by iron quantitation with atomic absorption spectroscopy. The results were correlated to individual liver iron concentrations, measured non-invasively by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) biomagnetometry. A close correlation between serum concentrations of ferritin protein and ferritin iron was found (r = 0.92) in all groups of patients. However, the correlation between ferritin iron concentration and individual liver iron concentration was poor in patients with hemochromatosis (r = 0.63) and patients with $\beta$-thalassemia major (r = 0.57). The degree of ferritin iron saturation was about 5{\%} in iron-loaded patients, which contrasts with results in two recent studies but confirms older observations. In patients with liver cell damage, the ferritin iron saturation in serum was significantly higher than that found in groups with iron overload disease, probably indicating the release of intracellular iron-rich ferritin into the blood. The monitoring of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation indicated that the release of iron-rich and iron-poor ferritin occurred during phases of hepatocellular damage and inflammation, respectively. We find the benefits of serum ferritin iron measurement to be marginal in patients with iron overload disease. (J Lab Clin Med 2000;135:413-8)},

abstract = {Translation termination requires two codon-specific polypeptide release factors in prokaryotes and one omnipotent factor in eukaryotes. Sequences of 17 different polypeptide release factors from prokaryotes and eukaryotes were compared. The prokaryotic release factors share residues split into seven motifs. Conservation of many discrete, perhaps critical, amino acids is observed in eukaryotic release factors, as well as in the C-terminal portion of elongation factor (EF) G. Given that the C-terminal domains of EF-G interacts with ribosomes by mimicry of a tRNA structure, the pattern of conservation of residues in release factors may reflect requirements for a tRNA-mimicry for binding to the A site of the ribosome. This mimicry would explain why release factors recognize stop codons and suggests that all prokaryotic and eukaryotic release factors evolved from the progenitor of EF-G.},

abstract = {Lily (Lilium formosanum or Lilium longiflorum) pollen tubes, microinjected with a low concentration of the pH-sensitive dye bis-carboxyethyl carboxyfluorescein dextran, show oscillating pH changes in their apical domain relative to growth. An increase in pH in the apex precedes the fastest growth velocities, whereas a decline follows growth, suggesting a possible relationship between alkalinity and cell extension. A target for pH may be the actin cytoskeleton, because the apical cortical actin fringe resides in the same region as the alkaline band in lily pollen tubes and elongation requires actin polymerization. A pH-sensitive actin binding protein, actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF), together with actin-interacting protein (AIP) localize to the cortical actin fringe region. Modifying intracellular pH leads to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, especially in the apical domain. Acidification causes actin filament destabilization and inhibits growth by 80{\%}. Upon complete growth inhibition, the actin fringe is the first actin cytoskeleton component to disappear. We propose that during normal growth, the pH increase in the alkaline band stimulates the fragmenting activity of ADF/AIP, which in turn generates more sites for actin polymerization. Increased actin polymerization supports faster growth rates and a proton influx, which inactivates ADF/AIP, decreases actin polymerization, and retards growth. As pH stabilizes and increases, the activity of ADF/AIP again increases, repeating the cycle of events.},

The results showed that the anthocyanin contents in leaves of 'Xiaoyan 54' and 'Jing 411' increased greatly when subjected to high light for 24 and 48 h at 25°C while increased slowly at both 30°C and 15°C. At 25°C when 'Jing 411' was subjected to high light for 48 h, its anthocyanin content was 7.2 g . g -1 FW, about ten times higher than that of 'Xiaoyan 54'. For 'Jing 411' treated under high light for 48 h, its anthocyanin content decreased from first to third leaf as well as according to leaf sheath, leaf base, middle leaf part, and leaf tip. In agreement with the increase of anthocyanin content by high light, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity was also induced by high light in both varieties. Further, high light induced anthocyanin accumulation was dependent upon genotypes. We found that varieties with purple coleoptiles accumulated more anthocyanin than those with green coleoptiles. Additionally, the absorbance peak of anthocyanin extracts in different varieties was at 520 nm. The high light induced anthocyanin accumulation may be a mechanism for purple coleoptiles varieties to cope with high light stress. This study might benefit for further study on the role of anthocyanin for wheat to conquer high light.},

Deletions and mutations involving INK4a occur frequently in cancers, implying that p16INK4a, like pRB, suppresses tumor formation. An unrelated protein (p19ARF) arises in major part from an alternative reading frame of the mouse INK4a gene, and its ectopic expression in the nucleus of rodent fibroblasts induces G1 and G2 phase arrest. Economical reutilization of coding sequences in this manner is practically without precedent in mammalian genomes, and the unitary inheritance of p16INK4a and p19ARF may underlie their dual requirement in cell cycle control.},

Binding sites were seen as single fluorescence peaks in cross-sections through the cell. Their number matched, at conditions of saturated binding, the number of sites expected from biochemical determination. By fitting the peaks to the point-spread-function, well approximated by a Gaussian distribution, resolution of channel positions to within 40nm was obtained in all three dimensions. Within the focal plane (x-y plane) positional resolution is given by the accuracy of determining the peak position of the Gaussian. The positional resolution along the optical axis (z-direction) was obtained from the accuracy of estimating the position of minimum defocusing for a single molecule. For this, the width of the fluorescence peaks in consecutive images, taken at different degrees of defocusing, were shown to accurately match the theoretical prediction, yielding sim40nm accuracy of finding the z-position of the labeled channels. This first visualization of individual membrane proteins in live cells by fluorescence labeled ligands with 40nm 3D positional resolution opens new perspectives for the study of cellular organization and processes at the molecular level.},

abstract = {Members of the K(2P) potassium channel family regulate neuronal excitability and are implicated in pain, anaesthetic responses, thermosensation, neuroprotection, and mood. Unlike other potassium channels, K(2P)s are gated by remarkably diverse stimuli that include chemical, thermal, and mechanical modalities. It has remained unclear whether the various gating inputs act through separate or common channel elements. Here, we show that protons, heat, and pressure affect activity of the prototypical, polymodal K(2P), K(2P)2.1 (KCNK2/TREK-1), at a common molecular gate that comprises elements of the pore-forming segments and the N-terminal end of the M4 transmembrane segment. We further demonstrate that the M4 gating element is conserved among K(2P)s and is employed regardless of whether the gating stimuli are inhibitory or activating. Our results define a unique gating mechanism shared by K(2P) family members and suggest that their diverse sensory properties are achieved by coupling different molecular sensors to a conserved core gating apparatus.},

These embrace the three great Pacific voyages, and it is a happy circumstance that the two volumes covering the third voyage, and which complete a series of four massive volumes, have been published by the Cambridge University Press in 1967 in good time for the 200th anniversary, on 26 August this year, of the sailing from Plymouth of Cook in the Endeavour on his first great voyage to the Pacific. Having loosed the topsails as a signal for sailing and hoisted a Jack at the fore topmast to inform Mr. Banks to come on board on 25 August 1768, Cook sailed in Endeavour next day. The undramatic entry in his journal began—‘At 2 p.m. got under sail and put to sea having on board 94 persons including Officers, Seamen, Gentlemen and their Servants, near 18 months provisions, 10 Carriage guns, 12 Swivels with good store of Ammunition and stores of all kinds’. Now, with these four volumes, the Hakluyt Society, for the first time, has made available to us the daily entries set down by Cook from that first day of sailing in 1768, throughout the three voyages, until his final entry on 17 January 1779.},

Anthocyanin and mRNA abundance in sheaths of maize seedlings increased with the severity and duration of cold. Anthocyanin accumulation was found in all tested lines that were genotypically capable of any anthocyanin production. Within 24 h of transferring 7-d maize (B37N) seedlings to 10 degrees C, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (Pal) (EC 4.3.1.5)-homologous and chalcone synthase (C2) (EC 2.3.1.74) transcript levels increased at least 8- and 50-fold, respectively, and 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4Cl) (EC 6.2.1.12)-homologous and chalcone isomerase (Chi) (EC 5.5.1.6)-homologous transcripts increased at least 3-fold over levels in unstressed plants. Time-course studies showed that Pal (EC 4.3.1.5) and C2-transcript levels remained relatively constant for the first 12 h of cold stress, dramatically increased over the next 12 h, and declined to pretreatment levels within 2 d of returning cold-stressed seedlings to ambient (25 degrees C) temperature. Transcripts 4Cl (EC 6.2.1.12) and Chi (EC 5.5.1.6) increased in abundance within 6 h of cold stress, exhibited no further increase over the next 36 h, and declined to pretreatment levels upon returning seedlings to 25 degrees C. Transcripts homologous to two regulatory (R, C1) and three structural (A1, A2, and Bz2) anthocyanin genes increased at least 7- to 10-fold during cold treatment, exhibiting similar kinetics of accumulation as for Pal (EC 4.3.1.5) and C2 transcripts. Transcripts encoded by Bz1, the anthocyanin structural gene for UDP:glucose-flavonol glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.91), were relatively abundant in control tissues and exhibited only a transient increase during the cold period. Our studies suggest that the genes of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway can be considered cor (Cold-Regulation) genes, and because this pathway is well defined, it is an excellent subject for characterizing plant molecular responses to low temperatures.},

Real-time PCR is easy to perform, provides the necessary accuracy and produces reliable as well as rapid quantification results. But accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis. This study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR of a target gene transcript in comparison to a reference gene transcript. Therefore, a new mathematical model is presented. The relative expression ratio is calculated only from the real-time PCR efficiencies and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. This model needs no calibration curve. Control levels were included in the model to standardise each reaction run with respect to RNA integrity, sample loading and inter-PCR variations. High accuracy and reproducibility (<2.5{\%} variation) were reached in LightCycler PCR using the established mathematical model.},

abstract = {The family of voltage-gated potassium channels in plants presumably evolved from a common ancestor and includes both inward-rectifying (K(in)) channels that allow plant cells to accumulate K(+) and outward-rectifying (K(out)) channels that mediate K(+) efflux. Despite their close structural similarities, the activity of K(in) channels is largely independent of K(+) and depends only on the transmembrane voltage, whereas that of K(out) channels responds to the membrane voltage and the prevailing extracellular K(+) concentration. Gating of potassium channels is achieved by structural rearrangements within the last transmembrane domain (S6). Here we investigated the functional equivalence of the S6 helices of the K(in) channel KAT1 and the K(out) channel SKOR by domain-swapping and site-directed mutagenesis. Channel mutants and chimeras were analyzed after expression in Xenopus oocytes. We identified two discrete regions that influence gating differently in both channels, demonstrating a lack of functional complementarity between KAT1 and SKOR. Our findings are supported by molecular models of KAT1 and SKOR in the open and closed states. The role of the S6 segment in gating evolved differently during specialization of the two channel subclasses, posing an obstacle for the transfer of the K(+)-sensor from K(out) to K(in) channels.},

abstract = {Changes in oxygen isotope ratios from shell carbonates are mainly dependent on sea surface temperature, which enables the estimation of temperatures during periods of shell growth and helps to determine the season of the year when the mollusk died. The marine topshell Phorcus lineatus (Da Costa, 1778) is commonly found in Holocene archaeological deposits of Atlantic Europe and is one of the most abundant subsistence resources utilized during the Mesolithic in northern Spain. Before applying isotopic techniques to ancient samples, calibration of the past isotopic data and its variability must be performed through the study of modern specimens to test their potential as paleoclimate proxy and their suitability for determining the collection season. Although previous studies performed in the region highlighted the existing relationship between sea surface temperatures and isotopic signatures, no systematic works have been done so far. In this paper, calibration of modern P. lineatus shells from northern Spain was carried out using {\{}delta{\}}18O analysis. The results showed (1) the existence of a robust inverse correlation between instrumental temperatures (T meas) and {\{}delta{\}}18Oshell (R 2 > 0.9), accompanied by the lack of significant dependence from {\{}delta{\}}18Owater variations (R 2 = 0.06); (2) the existence of conditions of (or close to) isotopic equilibrium during the formation of the aragonite in the P. lineatus shells; and (3) that using mean annual {\{}delta{\}}18Owater values, past temperatures could be calculated with a maximum uncertainty of {\{}+/-{\}}3{\{}degrees{\}}C. Moreover, results suggested that P. lineatus generally grew without substantial slow/cessation throughout the year, reflecting the four annual seasons. Therefore, our study not only confirms the potential of oxygen isotope analysis on P. lineatus for paleoclimate reconstruction and archaeological studies highlighted in previous studies but also shows for the first time that the aragonite of those shells grew under conditions of isotopic equilibrium, opening new avenues for future research.},

abstract = {Sodium permeation into cortex cells of wheat roots was examined under conditions of high external NaCI and low Ca(2+). Two types of K(+) inward rectifier were observed in some cells. The time-dependent K(+) inward rectifier was Ca(2+)-sensitive, increasing in magnitude as external Ca(2+) was decreased from 10 mM to 0.1 mM, but did not show significant permeability to Na(+). However, the spiky inward rectifier showed significant Na+ permeation at Ca(2+) concentrations of 1 and 10 mM. In cells that initially did not show K(+) inward rectifier channels, fast and sometimes slowly activating whole-cell inward currents were induced at membrane potentials negative of zero with high external Na(+) and low Ca(2+) concentrations. With 1 mM Ca(2+) in the external solution, large inward currents were carried by Rb(+), Cs(+), K(+), Li(+), and Na(+). The permeability sequence shows that K(+), Rb(+) and Cs(+) are all more permeant than Na(+), which is about equally as permeant as Li(+). When some K(+) was present with high concentrations of Na(+) the inward currents were larger than with K(+) or Na(+) alone. About 60{\%} of the inward current was reversibly blocked when the external Ca(2+) activity was increased from 0.03 mM to 2.7 mM (half inhibition at 0.31 mM Ca(2+) activity). Changes in the characteristics of the current noise indicated that increased Ca(2+) reduced the apparent single channel amplitude. In outside-out patches inward currents were observed at membrane potentials more positive than the equilibrium potentials for K(+) and Cl(-) when the external Na(+) concentration was high. These channels were difficult to analyse but three analysis methods yielded similar conductances of about 30 pS.},

abstract = {The telomeric region of chromosome 9p, is paralogous to the pericentromeric regions of chromosome 9 as well as to 2q13, the site of an ancestral telomere-telomere fusion. These paralogous regions span approximately 200 kb and contain seven transcriptional units, including the previously identified CBWD, FOXD4, PGM5, F379, CXYorfI, and two human Unigene clusters, Hs.115173 and Hs.189160. Within these gene duplicates, the number of expressed paralogous loci varies, from one in PGM5 to all three in CBWD and Hs.115173. FOXD4 shows the most dramatic changes among its paralogs. Two independent insertion/deletion changes created four different carboxy ends of these intronless genes, two of which are within the 2q13 locus. A comparison of K-A/K-S values among functional paralogs shows these genes evolved rapidly in primates. This study shows the importance of paralogous regions in the generation of transcriptional diversity and highlights the significance that large-scale telomeric duplication may play in this process.

abstract = {Stock enhancement is an attractive option for the management of fisheries but needs to be carefully evaluated before large-scale implementation. We advocate an experimental approach to test the hypothesis that reseeded stocks will yield greater harvests than unseeded controls. We tested the effectiveness of releasing hatchery-reared juveniles to enhance stocks of the topshell Trochus niloticus in Australia, Indonesia and Vanuatu using a rigorous design enabling direct comparisons among countries. Trochus were released at different sizes (6-12, 16-27 mm) and densities (2-8 m2) at replicated sites in each region. Populations at those sites were subsequently compared with those at unseeded controls. Temporal variation in success was also assessed by repeating the experiment in Indonesia. Initial survival was monitored by tagging the juveniles with aluminium foil and recapturing them using underwater metal detectors. The majority of juveniles released in Australia and Indonesia died or disappeared within a month of release and stocks were not enhanced relative to controls. Predation, especially by fish, was considered likely to be the most important cause of loss, but further investigation is required. Losses in Vanuatu were also substantial, but up to 4.4{\%} of 10-27 mm juveniles were recaptured alive after 12 months. Results from Australia and Vanuatu suggested that survival may be improved by releasing juveniles in greater densities and at greater sizes. We discuss additional strategies for improving survival of free-released juveniles in Vanuatu and suggest alternative approaches for Australia and Indonesia. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The AKT2 K(+) channel is endowed with unique functional properties, being the only weak inward rectifier characterized to date in Arabidopsis. The gene is expressed widely, mainly in the phloem but also at lower levels in leaf epiderm, mesophyll, and guard cells. The AKT2 mRNA level is upregulated by abscisic acid. By screening a two-hybrid cDNA library, we isolated a protein phosphatase 2C (AtPP2CA) involved in abscisic acid signaling as a putative partner of AKT2. We further confirmed the interaction by in vitro binding studies. The expression of AtPP2CA (beta-glucuronidase reporter gene) displayed a pattern largely overlapping that of AKT2 and was upregulated by abscisic acid. Coexpression of AtPP2CA with AKT2 in COS cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes was found to induce both an inhibition of the AKT2 current and an increase of the channel inward rectification. Site-directed mutagenesis and pharmacological analysis revealed that this functional interaction involves AtPP2CA phosphatase activity. Regulation of AKT2 activity by AtPP2CA in planta could allow the control of K(+) transport and membrane polarization during stress situations.},

abstract = {Summary The turgor pressure of growing pollen tubes of the lily (Lilium longiflorum Thunb.) has been recorded using a turgor pressure probe. Insertion of the probe's micropipette was routinely accomplished, providing recording periods of 20 to 30 min. Probe insertion did not affect tube growth. The stable turgor values ranged between 0.1 and 0.4 MPa, the mean value being 0.209 ± 0.064 MPa (n=106). A brief increase in turgor, generated by injection of oil through the pressure probe, caused the tube to burst at its tip. Burst pressures ranged between 0.19 and 0.58 MPa, that is, individual lily pollen tubes do not withstand turgor pressure approaching twice their regular turgor pressure. In contrast, parallel experiments using the incipient plasmolysis technique yielded a mean putative turgor pressure of 0.79 MPa either using sucrose (n=24) or mannitol (n=25). Surprisingly, turgor pressure was not significantly correlated with tube growth rate which ranged from zero to 13 µm/min. Nor did it correlate with tube length over the tested range of 100 to 1600 µm. In addition the influence of the medium's osmolality was surprisingly low: raising the external osmotic pressure from 0.36 to 1.08 MPa, with sucrose or mannitol, only caused mean turgor pressure to decline from 0.27 to 0.18 MPa. We conclude that growing lily pollen regulates its turgor pressure remarkably well despite substantial variation in tube growth rate, tube length, and osmotic milieu.},

abstract = {Transcription of a gene usually ends at a regulated termination point, preventing the RNA-polymerase from reading through the next gene. However, sporadic reports suggest that chimeric transcripts, formed by transcription of two consecutive genes into one RNA, can occur in human. The splicing and translation of such RNAs can lead to a new, fused protein, having domains from both original proteins. Here, we systematically identified over 200 cases of intergenic splicing in the human genome (involving 421 genes), and experimentally demonstrated that at least half of these fusions exist in human tissues. We showed that unique splicing patterns dominate the functional and regulatory nature of the resulting transcripts, and found intergenic distance bias in fused compared with nonfused genes. We demonstrate that the hundreds of fused genes we identified are only a subset of the actual number of fused genes in human. We describe a novel evolutionary mechanism where transcription-induced chimerism followed by retroposition results in a new, active fused gene. Finally, we provide evidence that transcription-induced chimerism can be a mechanism contributing to the evolution of protein complexes.},

abstract = {Pollen tube growth attracts our attention as a model system for studying cell elongation in plants. The process is fast, it is confined to the tip of the tube, and it is crucial for sexual reproduction in plants. In the enclosed review we focus on the control of pollen tube growth, giving special attention to the role of ions, especially calcium and protons. During the last decade technical advances have made it possible to detect localized intracellular gradients, and extracellular fluxes of calcium and protons in the apical domain. Other ions, notably potassium and chloride, are also receiving attention. An important development has been the realization that pollen tube growth oscillates in rate; in addition, the ion gradients and fluxes oscillate in magnitude. Although all the ionic oscillations show the same period as that of the growth rate, with the exception of extracellular chloride efflux, they are not in phase with growth. Considerable effort is devoted to the elucidation of these different phase relationships, with the view that a hierarchical order may provide clues about those events that are primary vs. secondary in growth control. Attention is also given to the targets for the ions, for example, the secretory system, the cytoskeleton, the cell wall, in an attempt to provide a global understanding of pollen tube growth},

abstract = {Plant outward-rectifying K+ channels mediate K+ efflux from guard cells during stomatal closure and from root cells into the xylem for root-shoot allocation of potassium (K). Intriguingly, the gating of these channels depends on the extracellular K+ concentration, although the ions carrying the current are derived from inside the cell. This K+ dependence confers a sensitivity to the extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]) that ensures that the channels mediate K+ efflux only, regardless of the [K+] prevailing outside. We investigated the mechanism of K+-dependent gating of the K+ channel SKOR of Arabidopsis by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations affecting the intrinsic K+ dependence of gating were found to cluster in the pore and within the sixth transmembrane helix (S6), identifying an 'S6 gating domain' deep within the membrane. Mapping the SKOR sequence to the crystal structure of the voltage-dependent K+ channel KvAP from Aeropyrum pernix suggested interaction between the S6 gating domain and the base of the pore helix, a prediction supported by mutations at this site. These results offer a unique insight into the molecular basis for a physiologically important K+-sensory process in plants.},

abstract = {The initial discovery that ras genes endowed retroviruses with potent carcinogenic properties and the subsequent determination that mutated ras genes were present in a wide variety of human cancers, prompted a strong suspicion that the growth-promoting actions of mutated Ras proteins contribute to their aberrant regulation of growth stimulatory signaling pathways. In 1993, a remarkable convergence of experimental observations from genetic analyses of Drosophila, S. cerevisiae and C. elegans as well as biochemical and biological studies in mammalian cells came together to define a clear role for Ras in signal transduction, What emerged was an elegant linear signaling pathway where Ras functions as a relay switch that is positioned downstream of cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases and upstream of a cytoplasmic cascade of kinases that included the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Activated MAPKs in turn regulated the activities of nuclear transcription factors. Thus, a signaling cascade where every component between the cell surface and the nucleus was defined and conserved in worms, flies and man. This was a remarkable achievement in our efforts to appreciate how the aberrant function of Ras proteins may contribute to the malignant growth properties of the cancer cell, However, the identification of this pathway has proven to be just the beginning, rather than the culmination, of our understanding of Ras in signal transduction, Instead, we now appreciate that this simple linear pathway represents but a minor component of a very complex signaling circuitry. Ras signaling has emerged to involve a complex array of signaling pathways, where cross-talk, feedback loops, branch points and multi-component signaling complexes are recurring themes. The simplest concept of a signaling cascade, where each component simply relays the same message to the next, is clearly not the case. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of Ras signal transduction with an emphasis on new complexities associated with the recognition and/or activation of cellular effecters, and the diverse array of signaling, pathways mediated by interaction between Ras and Ras-subfamily proteins with multiple effecters.},

abstract = {The vacuole represents a pivotal plant organelle for management of ion homeostasis, storage of proteins and solutes, as well as deposition of cytotoxic compounds. Ion channels, pumps and carriers in the vacuolar membrane under control of cytosolic factors provide for ionic and metabolic homeostasis between this storage organelle and the cytoplasm. Here we show that AtTPK1 (KCO1), a vacuolar membrane localized K(+) channel of the TPK family, interacts with 14-3-3 proteins (general regulating factors, GRFs). Following in planta expression TPK1 and GRF6 co-localize at the vacuolar membrane. Co-localization of wild-type TPK1, but not the TPK1-S42A mutant, indicates that phosphorylation of the 14-3-3 binding motif of TPK1 represents a prerequisite for interaction. Pull-down assays and surface plasmon resonance measurements revealed GRF6 high-affinity interaction with TPK1. Following expression of TPK1 in yeast and isolation of vacuoles, patch-clamp studies identified TPK1 as a voltage-independent and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel. Addition of 14-3-3 proteins strongly increased the TPK1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. However, an inverse effect of GRF6 on the activity of the slow-activating vacuolar (SV) channel was observed in mesophyll vacuoles from Arabidopsis thaliana. Thus, TPK1 seems to provide for a Ca(2+)- and 14-3-3-sensitive mechanism capable of controlling cytoplasmic potassium homeostasis in plants.},

abstract = {To test whether insect antennae are necessary for eliciting courtship and aggression toward appropriate partners, we antennectomized adult male crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) and observed their behavior toward other antennectomized males and intact females. At 7 days after removal of both antennae, pairs of antennectomized males were placed together; 80{\%} displayed courtship behavior, generating courtship song by rubbing their forewings together, toward other antennectomized males, and 20{\%} displayed aggressive behavior. Only 45{\%} courted intact females. No intact males courted antennectomized males, and 80{\%} displayed aggressive behavior. All intact males courted females. The results for males with one antenna removed were essentially the same as for intact males. These findings indicate that a high proportion of male crickets with both antennae removed court other males and fail to display male-male aggression, demonstrating that removal of antennae from male crickets induces male-male courtship and that an antenna is necessary for the expression of male-male aggression. Moreover, brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) levels in male crickets were significantly reduced at 7 days after removal of antennae. The reduction of 5-HT was detected primarily in the central body of the brain. Thus, 5-HT in the central body of the male cricket brain may be involved in the behavioral changes.

abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). These trams-membrane proteins are activated following binding with peptide growth factors of the EGF-family of proteins. Evidence suggests that the EGFR is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of different carcinoma types. The EGFR and EGF-like peptides are often over-expressed in human carcinomas, and in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that these proteins are able to induce cell transformation. Amplification of the EGFR gene and mutations of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain have been recently demonstrated to occur in carcinoma patients. Interestingly, both these genetic alterations of the EGFR are correlated with high probability to respond to anti-EGFR agents. However, ErbB proteins and their ligands form a complex system in which the interactions occurring between receptors and ligands affect the type and the duration of the intracellular signals that derive from receptor activation. In fact, proteins of the ErbB family form either home- or hetero-dimers following ligand binding, each dimer showing different affinity for ligands and different signaling properties. In this regard, evidence suggests that cooperation of multiple ErbB receptors and cognate ligands is necessary to induce cell transformation. In particular, the growth and the survival of carcinoma cells appear to be sustained by a network of receptors/ligands of the ErbB family. This phenomenon is also important for therapeutic approaches, since the response to anti-EGFR agents might depend on the total level of expression of ErbB receptors and ligands in tumor cells.

Genetic and molecular definition of these three immune hallmarks of cancer offers the opportunity to learn how to deploy specific countermeasures to reverse the situation in favor of the immune system and, eventually, the patient.

abstract = {Two mechanisms have been proposed as the primary control of oscillating tip growth in Lilium longiflorum Thunb. pollen tubes: changes in cell wall strength (Holdaway-Clarke et al. 1997) or alternatively, changes in turgor pressure (Messerli et al. 2000). Here we have modified the ionic and osmotic concentrations of the growth medium to test predictions derived from both models. Raising the [Ca2+]o tenfold above normal reduced the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i oscillations and growth oscillations while it raised the basal [Ca2+]i and growth rate such that the average growth rate did not change. Raising the [H+] of the growth medium tenfold reversibly decreased and sometimes eliminated the [Ca2+]i and growth oscillations without changing the average growth rate. Lowering the [H+] tenfold led to irregular frequency and amplitude [Ca2+]i oscillations, reduced the average growth rate of tubes and led to cell bursting in 33{\%} of tubes. Addition of 50 mM H+ buffer, MES, to prevent pH changes in the cell wall increased the period, amplitude and duration of both [Ca2+]i and growth oscillations. Changing the [K+]o did not markedly effect [Ca2+]i oscillations. Reducing the osmolarity of the medium led to transient large-amplitude [Ca2+]i and growth oscillations while reducing large-amplitude oscillations over long periods. In many different conditions under which growth still occurs, lily pollen tubes maintain growth oscillations, albeit with modified frequency, amplitude and duration. We conclude that modifications to both proposed models are necessary to explain oscillating growth in this system.},

We now show that K(+) is bound to the proton pump at a site involving Asp(617) in the cytoplasmic phosphorylation domain, from where it is unlikely to be transported. Binding of K(+) to this site can induce dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated E(1)P reaction cycle intermediate by a mechanism involving Glu(184) in the conserved TGES motif of the pump actuator domain. Our data identify K(+) as an intrinsic uncoupler of the proton pump and suggest a mechanism for control of the H(+)/ATP coupling ratio. K(+)-induced dephosphorylation of E(1)P may serve regulatory purposes and play a role in negative regulation of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient under cellular conditions where E(1)P is accumulating.},

abstract = {All living cells have an absolute requirement for K+, which must be taken up from the external medium. In contrast to marine organisms, which live in a medium with an inexhaustible supply of K+, terrestrial life evolved in oligotrophic environments where the low supply of K+ limited the growth of colonizing plants. In these limiting conditions Na+ could substitute for K+ in some cellular functions, but in others it is toxic. In the vacuole, Na+ is not toxic and can undertake osmotic functions, reducing the total K+ requirements and improving growth when the lack of K+ is a limiting factor. Because of these physiological requirements, the terrestrial life of plants depends on high-affinity K+ uptake systems and benefits from high-affinity Na+ uptake systems. In plants, both systems have received extensive attention during recent years and a clear insight of their functions is emerging. Some plant HAK transporters mediate high-affinity K+ uptake in yeast, mimicking K+ uptake in roots, while other members of the same family may be K+ transporters in the tonoplast. In parallel with the HAK transporters, some HKT transporters mediate high-affinity Na+ uptake without cotransporting K+. HKT transporters have two functions: (i) to take up Na+ from the soil solution to reduce K+ requirements when K+ is a limiting factor, and (ii) to reduce Na+ accumulation in leaves by both removing Na+ from the xylem sap and loading Na+ into the phloem sap.},

abstract = {The linear sequence specification of a gene product is not provided by the target DNA sequence alone but by the mechanisms of gene expressions. The main actors of these mechanisms, proteins and functional RNAs, relay environmental information to the genome with important consequences to sequence selection and processing. This `postgenomic' reality has implications for our understandings of development not as predetermined by genes but as an epigenetic process. Critics of genetic determinism have long argued that the activity of `genes' and hence their contribution to the phenotype depends on intra- and extraorganismal `environmental' elements. As will be shown here, even the mere physical existence of a `gene' is dependent on its phenotypic context.},

abstract = {Small RNAs ranging in size between 18 and 30 nucleotides (nt) are found in many organisms including yeasts, plants, and animals. Small RNAs are involved in the regulation of gene expression through translational repression, mRNA degradation, and chromatin modification. In mammals, microRNAs (miRNAs) are the only small RNAs that have been well characterized. Here, we have identified two novel classes of small RNAs in the mouse germline. One class consists of approximately 20- to 24-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from mouse oocytes, which are derived from retroelements including LINE, SINE, and LTR retrotransposons. Addition of retrotransposon-derived sequences to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of a reporter mRNA destabilizes the mRNA significantly when injected into full-grown oocytes. These results suggest that retrotransposons are suppressed through the RNAi pathway in mouse oocytes. The other novel class of small RNAs is 26- to 30-nt germline small RNAs (gsRNAs) from testes. gsRNAs are expressed during spermatogenesis in a developmentally regulated manner, are mapped to the genome in clusters, and have strong strand bias. These features are reminiscent of Tetrahymena approximately 23- to 24-nt small RNAs and Caenorhabditis elegans X-cluster small RNAs. A conserved novel small RNA pathway may be present in diverse animals.},

These methods can uncover important membrane domains of channel activity as well as link molecular fluxes with important physiological processes to which they are related. In plant cells the use of extra-cellular stepping (or vibrating) microelectrodes is of particular importance since other electrophysiological methods (e.g patch-clamp) are of difficult or limited use due to the presence of an external cell wall. Of particular impact, the use of ion-selective microelectrodes has been pivotal to characterize ion-driven processes in a number of cells and organs. The strategy of measurement and analysis is crucial in applying this technology and it is important to explain the underlying theory and methods by which these measurements and analysis are accomplished. Here we describe some of the physical and technical foundations of the method, and review some applications to plant systems in recent years.},

abstract = {Inward-rectifying potassium (K+(in)) channels in guard cells have been suggested to provide a pathway for K+ uptake into guard cells during stomatal opening. To test the proposed role of guard cell K+(in) channels in light-induced stomatal opening, transgenic Arabidopsis plants were generated that expressed dominant negative point mutations in the K+(in) channel subunit KAT1. Patch-clamp analyses with transgenic guard cells from independent lines showed that K+(in) current magnitudes were reduced by approximately 75{\%} compared with vector-transformed controls at -180 mV, which resulted in reduction in light-induced stomatal opening by 38{\%} to 45{\%} compared with vector-transformed controls. Analyses of intracellular K+ content using both sodium hexanitrocobaltate (III) and elemental x-ray microanalyses showed that light-induced K+ uptake was also significantly reduced in guard cells of K+(in) channel depressor lines. These findings support the model that K+(in) channels contribute to K+ uptake during light-induced stomatal opening. Furthermore, transpirational water loss from leaves was reduced in the K+(in) channel depressor lines. Comparisons of guard cell K+(in) current magnitudes among four different transgenic lines with different K+(in) current magnitudes show the range of activities of K+(in) channels required for guard cell K+ uptake during light-induced stomatal opening.},

abstract = {In previous studies, we showed that acute administration of iron to intact rats or to rat hepatoma cells in culture induces synthesis of the iron-storage protein ferritin by activating translation of inactive cytoplasmic ferritin mRNAs for both the heavy (H) and the light (L) subunits. In the course of activation, these ferritin mRNAs are recruited onto polysomes. To elucidate the structural features of these mRNAs involved in the translational response to iron, a chimera was constructed from the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of ferritin L subunit mRNA fused to the reading frame of the mRNA of bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). This chimera and deletion constructs derived from it were introduced into a rat hepatoma cell line by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. The complete chimera showed increased CAT activity in response to iron enrichment of the medium, whereas deletion of the first 67 nucleotides of the 5' UTR, which contain a highly conserved sequence, caused loss of regulation by iron. Whereas cis-acting sequences located in the 5' flanking regions of many genes have been repeatedly implicated in modulating their transcriptional expression, we report here a specific regulatory translational sequence found within the 5' UTR of a eukaryotic mRNA.},

Cineole, l-fenchone, and pulegone at 50??g,ml air caused 100{\%} mortality in all five species tested. Ketone compounds were generally more toxic than other monoterpenoids. Three monoterpenoids, the ketones pulegone, l-fenchone, and the aldehyde perillaldehyde, were selected for further study. They were effective against T. castaneum in the fumigation assay; however the toxicity was relatively low in comparison to dichlorvos. LC50 values of these three monoterpenoids tended to decrease at longer exposure times and higher temperatures. Inclusion of either maize kernels or house fly medium (HFM) increased LC50 values, HFM more so than maize kernels. Monoterpenoids may be suitable as fumigants or vapor-phase insecticides because of their high volatility, fumigation efficacy, and their safety. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Species richness is a fundamental measurement of community and regional diversity, and it underlies many ecological models and conservation strategies. In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category±subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to- individual ratios). Rarefaction methods ± both sample-based and individual-based ± allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is a pervasive epigenetic DNA modification that strongly affects chromatin regulation and gene expression. To date, it remains largely unknown how patterns of DNA methylation differ between closely related species and whether such differences contribute to species-specific phenotypes. To investigate these questions, we generated nucleotide-resolution whole-genome methylation maps of the prefrontal cortex of multiple humans and chimpanzees. Levels and patterns of DNA methylation vary across individuals within species according to the age and the sex of the individuals. We also found extensive species-level divergence in patterns of DNA methylation and that hundreds of genes exhibit significantly lower levels of promoter methylation in the human brain than in the chimpanzee brain. Furthermore, we investigated the functional consequences of methylation differences in humans and chimpanzees by integrating data on gene expression generated with next-generation sequencing methods, and we found a strong relationship between differential methylation and gene expression. Finally, we found that differentially methylated genes are strikingly enriched with loci associated with neurological disorders, psychological disorders, and cancers. Our results demonstrate that differential DNA methylation might be an important molecular mechanism driving gene-expression divergence between human and chimpanzee brains and might potentially contribute to the evolution of disease vulnerabilities. Thus, comparative studies of humans and chimpanzees stand to identify key epigenomic modifications underlying the evolution of human-specific traits.},

abstract = {Anthocyanins are natural pigments that accumulate only in light-grown and not in dark-grown Arabidopsis plants. Repression of anthocyanin accumulation in darkness requires the CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1/SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (COP1/SPA) ubiquitin ligase, as cop1 and spa mutants produce anthocyanins also in the dark. Here, we show that COP1 and SPA proteins interact with the myeloblastosis (MYB) transcription factors PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT1 (PAP)1 and PAP2, two members of a small protein family that is required for anthocyanin accumulation and for the expression of structural genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. The increased anthocyanin levels in cop1 mutants requires the PAP1 gene family, indicating that COP1 functions upstream of the PAP1 gene family. PAP1 and PAP2 proteins are degraded in the dark and this degradation is dependent on the proteasome and on COP1. Hence, the light requirement for anthocyanin biosynthesis results, at least in part, from the light-mediated stabilization of PAP1 and PAP2. Consistent with this conclusion, moderate overexpression of PAP1 leads to an increase in anthocyanin levels only in the light and not in darkness. Here we show that SPA genes are also required for reducing PAP1 and PAP2 transcript levels in dark-grown seedlings. Taken together, these results indicate that the COP1/SPA complex affects PAP1 and PAP2 both transcriptionally and post-translationally. Thus, our findings have identified mechanisms via which the COP1/SPA complex controls anthocyanin levels in Arabidopsis that may be useful for applications in biotechnology directed towards increasing anthocyanin content in plants.},

abstract = {Bischofia javanica Blume, an exotic tree, dominates many forest areas of the Bonin Islands in the western Pacific of Japan. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the success of B, javanica (a mid-successional plant species) is related to its high acclimation capacity to sudden light increase due to canopy gap formation. We compared its ecophysiological response to simulated canopy opening with those of native species of different successional status: Trema orientalis Blume, Schima mertensiana (Sieb, et Zucc.) Koidz, Elaeocarpus photiniaefolius Hook.Et Am, and Ardisia sieboldii Miquel. In all species, transfer of leaves developed in shade (5.3{\%} of full sun) to full sun resulted in a substantial initial reduction in the dark-adapted quantum yield of photosystem II. (Fv/Fm). T. orientalis, a pioneer plant species, showed the least reduction (38{\%}), whereas E. photiniaefolius and A. sieboldii, both late-successional plant species, demonstrated large reductions (about 80{\%}). In all four native species, Fv/Fm in shade leaves gradually recovered following transfer, but B. javanica recovered more fully and rapidly than the other species. Unlike Fv/Fm, the chlorophyll content in all species did not recover following the initial decline. This indicates that the recovery of quantum yield (Fv/Fm) was independent of the reduction in chlorophyll. Among all the species, B. javanica showed the highest (1) increase in maximum photosynthetic rate of shade leaves after transfer, (2) production of newly formed sun leaves, and (3) increase in relative growth rate. Ecophysiological characters of B. javanica in simulated canopy openings indicated rapid photosynthetic acclimation in existing shade leaves by minimizing photoinhibition and a rapid deployment of new sun leaves with high photosynthetic capacity. Because its habitats on these Pacific Islands are prone to typhoon disturbance, the successful invasion of B. javanica may lie in the congruence of its acclimation potential and the frequent gap events.},

Here we created 256 chimeras between the Kin channel KAT1 and the Kout channel SKOR. The chimeras were screened in a potassium-uptake deficient yeast strain to identify those, which mediate potassium inward currents, i.e., which are functionally equivalent to KAT1. This strategy allowed us to identify three chimeras which differ from KAT1 in three parts of the polypeptide: the cytosolic N-terminus, the cytosolic C-terminus, and the putative voltage-sensor S4. Additionally, mutations in the Kout channel SKOR were generated in order to localize molecular entities underlying its depolarization activation. The triple mutant SKOR-D312N-M313L-I314G, carrying amino-acid changes in the S6 segment, was identified as a channel which did not display any rectification in the tested voltage-range. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A scientific methodology in general should provide two things: first, a means of explanation and, second, a mechanism for improving that explanation. Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a method that facilitates exploring the collective effects of individual action selection. The explanatory force of the model is the extent to which an observed meta-level phenomenon can be accounted for by the behaviour of its micro-level actors. This article demonstrates that this methodology can be applied to the biological sciences; agent-based models, like any other scientific hypotheses, can be tested, critiqued, generalized or specified. We review the state of the art for ABM as a methodology for biology and then present a case study based on the most widely published agent-based model in the biological sciences: Hemelrijk's DomWorld, a model of primate social behaviour. Our analysis shows some significant discrepancies between this model and the behaviour of the macaques, the genus used for our analysis. We also demonstrate that the model is not fragile: its other results are still valid and can be extended to compensate for these problems. This robustness is a standard advantage of experiment-based artificial intelligence modelling techniques over analytic modelling.},

@article{Stitt1999,
abstract = {This review first summarizes the numerous studies that have described the interaction between the nitrogen supply and the response of photosynthesis, metabolism and growth to elevated [CO2]. The initial stimulation of photosynthesis in elevated [CO2] is often followed by a decline of photosynthesis, that is typically accompanied by a decrease of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), an accumulation of carbohydrate especially starch, and a decrease of the nitrogen concentration in the plant. These changes are particularly marked when the nitrogen supply is low, whereas when the nitrogen supply is adequate there is no acclimation of photosynthesis, no major decrease in the internal concentration of nitrogen or the levels of nitrogen metabolites, and growth is stimulated markedly. Second, emerging evidence is discussed that signals derived from nitrate and nitrogen metabolites such as glutamine act to regulate the expression of genes involved in nitrate and ammonium uptake and assimilation? organic acid synthesis and starch accumulation, to modulate the sugar-mediated repression of the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis, and to modulate whole plant events including shoot-root allocation, root architecture and flowering. Third, increased rates of growth in elevated [CO2] will require higher rates of inorganic nitrogen uptake and assimilation. Recent evidence is discussed that an increased supply of sugars can increase the rates of nitrate and ammonium uptake and assimilation, the synthesis of organic acid accepters, and the synthesis of amino acids. Fourth, interpretation of experiments in elevated [CO2] requires that the nitrogen status of the plants is monitored, The suitability of different criteria to assess the plant nitrogen status is critically discussed. Finally the review returns to experiments with elevated [CO2] and discusses the following topics: is, and if so how, are nitrate and ammonium uptake and metabolism stimulated in elevated [CO2], and does the result depend on the nitrogen supply? Is acclimation of photosynthesis the result of sugar-mediated repression of gene expression, end-product feedback of photosynthesis, nitrogen-induced senescence, or ontogenetic drift? Is the accumulation of starch a passive response to increased carbohydrate formation, or is it triggered by changes in the nutrient status? How do changes in sugar production and inorganic nitrogen assimilation interact in different conditions and at different stages of the life history to determine the response of whole plant growth and allocation to elevated [CO2]?},

abstract = {Root hair initiation involves the formation of a bulge at the basal end of the trichoblast by localized diffuse growth. Tip growth occurs subsequently at this initiation site and is accompanied by the establishment of a polarized cytoplasmic organization. Arabidopsis plants homozygous for a complete loss-of-function tiny root hair 1 (trh1) mutation were generated by means of the T-DNA-tagging method. Trichoblasts of trh1 plants form initiation sites but fail to undergo tip growth. A predicted primary structure of TRH1 indicates that it belongs to the AtKT/AtKUP/HAK K(+) transporter family. The proposed function of TRH1 as a K(+) transporter was confirmed in (86)Rb uptake experiments, which demonstrated that trh1 plants are partially impaired in K(+) transport. In line with these results, TRH1 was able to complement the trk1 potassium transporter mutant of Saccharomyces, which is defective in high-affinity K(+) uptake. Surprisingly, the trh1 phenotype was not restored when mutant seedlings were grown at high external potassium concentrations. These data demonstrate that TRH1 mediates K(+) transport in Arabidopsis roots and is responsible for specific K(+) translocation, which is essential for root hair elongation.},

However, their contents in soils are limited so that crop production needs to invest a lot for fertilizer supply. To explore the genetic potentialities of crops (or plants) for their nutrient utilization efficiency has been an important research task for many years. In fact, a number of evidences have revealed that plants, during their evolution, have developed many morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular adaptation mechanisms for acquiring nitrate, phosphate and potassium under stress conditions. Recent discoveries of many transporters and channels for nitrate, phosphate and potassium uptake have opened up opportunities to study the molecular regulatory mechanisms for acquisition of these nutrients. This review aims to briefly discuss the genes and gene families for these transporters and channels. In addition, the functions and regulation of some important transporters and channels are particularly emphasized.},

abstract = {The evolutionary hypotheses on plant-herbivore interaction assume that plant secondary compounds, such as the phlorotannins of brown algae, function as feeding deterrents for herbivores. We studied the effect of seaweed quality on the feeding preferences and performance of the isopod Idotea baltica. We offered I. baltica 6 species of algae, abundant in the Fucus vesiculosus belts where this mesograzer lives, in simultaneous preference tests. The tests were conducted both with natural algae and with artificial food made of freeze-dried and powdered algae of the same species. We found clear feeding preferences among the natural algae: the order of decreasing preference was F. vesiculosus > Dictyosiphon foeniculaceus > Elachista fucicola > Pilayella littoralis > Enteromorpha intestinalis > Ceramium tenuicorne. The preferences in the test with artificial food, however, did not parallel those with natural algae, suggesting that the chemical quality of algae is not the major determinant of feeding preferences. Furthermore, performance of isopods when reared on a diet of single algal species did not match the feeding preferences of natural algae: the most preferred brown alga provided poor growth rate. Surprisingly, the more phlorotannin a seaweed species contained, the more it was preferred by I. baltica. Moreover, the assimilation efficiency of soluble sugars was generally high when isopods fed on brown algae, and in the 2 species richest in phlorotannins it was not correlated with the phlorotannin concentration of the algal individual. In contrast to the conventional assumption of the defensive function of phlorotannins, this study shows that phlorotannins in seaweeds do not function as feeding deterrents to I. baltica. Instead, this herbivore readily feeds on phenolic-rich host plants, which, however, carries a cost in terms of decreased growth rate. We suggest that feeding preferences and habitat choice behavior evolve together; habitat structure, in terms of predation avoidance, and the spatiotemporal stability of the host algae are more important factors selecting for feeding preferences in mesoherbivores than the chemical composition of algae.},

abstract = {The characteristics of cation outward rectifier channels were studied in protoplasts from wheat root (Triticum aestivum L. and Triticum turgidum L.) cells using the patch clamp technique. The cation outward rectifier channels were voltage-dependent with a single channel conductance of 32 +/- 1 picosiemens in 100 millimolar KCl. Whole-cell currents were dominated by the activity of the cation outward rectifiers. The time- and voltage-dependence of these currents was accounted for by the summed behavior of individual channels recorded from outside-out detached patches. The K(+)/Na(+) permeability ratio of these channels was measured in a salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant genotype of wheat that differ in rates of Na(+) accumulation, using a voltage ramp protocol on protoplasts in the whole-cell configuration. Permeability ratios were calculated from shifts in reversal potentials following ion substitutions. There were no significant differences in the K(+)/Na(+) permeability ratios of these channels in root cells from either of the two genotypes tested. The permeability ratio for K(+)/Cl(-) was greater than 50:1. The K(+)/Na(+) permeability ratio averaged 30:1, which is two to four times more selective than the same type of channel in guard cells and suspension culture cells. Lowering the Ca(2+) concentration in the bath solution to 0.1 millimolar in the presence of 100 millimolar Na(+) had no significant effect on the K(+)/Na(+) permeability ratios of the channel. It seems unlikely that the mechanism of salt tolerance in wheat is based on differences in the K(+)/Na(+) selectivity of these channels.},

abstract = {The cGMP-gated cation channel mediating phototransduction in retinal rods has recently been shown to be inhibited by calcium-calmodulin, through direct binding of the latter to the beta-subunit of the heterotetrameric channel complex. Here, we report the characterization of this inhibition and the identification of a domain crucial for this modulation. Heterologous expression of the alpha- and beta-subunits of the human rod channel in HEK 293 cells produced a cGMP-gated current that was highly sensitive to calcium-calmodulin, with half-maximal inhibition at approximately 4 nM. In biochemical and electrophysiological experiments on deletion mutants of the beta-subunit, we have identified a region on its cytoplasmic N terminus that binds calmodulin and is necessary for the calmodulin-mediated inhibition of the channel. However, in gel shift assays and fluorescence emission experiments, peptides derived from this region indicated a low calmodulin affinity, with dissociation constants of approximately 3-10 microM. On the C terminus, a region was also found to bind calmodulin, but it was likewise of low affinity, and its deletion did not abolish the calmodulin-mediated inhibition. We suggest that although the identified region on the N terminus of the beta-subunit is crucial for the calmodulin effect, other regions are likely to be involved as well. In this respect, the rod channel appears to differ from the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel, which is also modulated by calcium-calmodulin.},

In addition, the capability of TPKs to act as osmosensors was determined. By using protoplast disruption assays and intact plant survival assays, in genotypes that differed in TPK expression, the physiological relevance of TPK-based osmosensing was tested. • TPKs from all three species showed varying degrees of mechanosensitivity. TPK activity in channels from all three species was sensitive to trans-tonoplast osmotic gradients. TPK osmosensing is likely to proceed via the detection of small perturbations in membrane tension. Intact plant and protoplast assays showed that TPK-based osmosensing is important during exposure to rapid changes in external osmolarity. • Vacuolar TPK channels can act as intracellular osmosensors and rapidly increase channel activity during hypo-osmotic shock to release vacuolar K(+) .},

Homology modelling and mutational analyses identified a pore-located aspartate residue (Asp110), which is involved in potassium permeation as well as in inward rectification of TPK4.

abstract = {Predators can affect the vertical distribution of mobile intertidal invertebrates in two ways: they can (1) cause greater mortality of prey at certain intertidal levels, and (2) induce prey to seek safer intertidal areas. In this study, we investigate whether low-intertidal and subtidal predators affect the intertidal distribution of two congeneric species of small herbivorous gastropods of northeastern Pacific Shores, Littorina sitkana Philippi 1846, and L. scutulata Gould 1849. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that predators affect the distribution of these snails by inducing them to seek higher and safer intertidal areas. On a wave-sheltered shore in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, L. sitkana and L. scutulata were both killed by predatory crabs (e.g., Cancer productus) more frequently when tethered near the lower limit of their intertidal distribution (≃ 1 m) than when tethered where they were most common (≃ 2.5 m), suggesting that high mortality rates are partly responsible for the lower-limit of these snails' intertidal distribution. However, two field mark-recapture experiments indicated that the snails' behavioral response to predation risk also influences their distribution. In the first experiment, snails from the 2.5-m level (low risk) transplanted to the 1.0-m level (high risk) displayed a strong and consistent tendency to move shoreward, especially L. sitkana, some traveling 10-15 m in 2-3 days to regain their original level. These shoreward movements were especially precise in the northern part of the study area, where predation rates on tethered snails were greatest. Furthermore, larger more vulnerable snails were more strongly oriented shoreward than smaller individuals, indicating that antipredator behavior might also contribute to intertidal size gradients in these species. In the second mark-recapture experiment, we manipulated predation risk using small cages and found that snails exposed to the odors of C. productus crabs foraging on conspecific and heterospecific snails displayed more precise (L. sitkana and L. scutulata) and longer (L. sitkana) shoreward movements than snails held in control conditions. These results provide the first experimental evidence that antipredator behavior may contribute to the intertidal distribution patterns of littorinids. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Potassium transporters play crucial roles in K(+) uptake and translocation in plants. However, so far little is known about the regulatory mechanism of potassium transporters. Here, we show that a Shaker-like potassium channel AtKC1, encoded by the AtLKT1 gene cloned from the Arabidopsis thaliana low-K(+) (LK)-tolerant mutant Atlkt1, significantly regulates AKT1-mediated K(+) uptake under LK conditions. Under LK conditions, the Atkc1 mutants maintained their root growth, whereas wild-type plants stopped their root growth. Lesion of AtKC1 significantly enhanced the tolerance of the Atkc1 mutants to LK stress and markedly increased K(+) uptake and K(+) accumulation in the Atkc1-mutant roots under LK conditions. Electrophysiological results showed that AtKC1 inhibited the AKT1-mediated inward K(+) currents and negatively shifted the voltage dependence of AKT1 channels. These results demonstrate that the 'silent' K(+) channel alpha-subunit AtKC1 negatively regulates the AKT1-mediated K(+) uptake in Arabidopsis roots and consequently alters the ratio of root-to-shoot under LK stress conditions.},

abstract = {The expansion of both root hairs and pollen tubes occurs by a process known as tip growth. In this report, an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant (tip1) is described that displays defects in both root-hair and pollen-tube growth. The root hairs of the tip1 mutant plants are shorter than those of the wild-type plants and branched at their base. The tip1 pollen-tube growth defect was identified by the aberrant segregation ratio of phenotypically normal to mutant seeds in siliques from self-pollinated, heterozygous plants. Homozygous mutant seeds are not randomly distributed in the siliques, comprising only 14.4{\%} of the total seeds, 5.3{\%} of the seeds from the bottom half, and 2.2{\%} of the seeds from the bottom quarter of the heterozygous siliques. Studies of pollen-tube growth in vivo showed that mutant pollen tubes grow more slowly than wild-type pollen through the transmitting tissue of wild-type flowers. Cosegregation studies indicate that the root-hair and pollen-tube defects are caused by the same genetic lesion. Based on these findings, the TIP1 gene is likely to encode a product involved in a fundamental aspect of tip growth in plant cells.},

abstract = {It is widely accepted that iron deposition in the iron storage protein ferritin in vitro involves Fe(II) oxidation, and that ferritin facilitates this oxidation at a ferroxidase site on the protein. However, these views have recently been questioned, with the protein ferroxidase activity instead being attributed to autoxidation from the buffer alone. Ligand exchange between another protein with ferroxidase activity and ferritin has been proposed as an alternative mechanism for iron incorporation into ferritin. In the present work, a pH stat apparatus is used to eliminate the influence of buffers on iron(II) oxidation. Here we show that the recent experiments questioning the ferroxidase activity of ferritin were flawed by inadequate pH control, that buffers actually retard rather than facilitate iron(II) oxidation, and that horse spleen ferritin has ferroxidase activity when measured under proper experimental conditions. Furthermore, high pH (7.0), a high Fe(II) concentration and the presence of Fe(III) all favour Fe(II) autoxidation in the presence or absence of ferritin.},

abstract = {The RAS/ERK pathway is commonly activated in carcinomas and promotes oncogenesis by altering transcriptional programs. However, the array of cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors that mediate these transcriptional changes is still unclear. Our genome-wide analysis determined that a sequence consisting of neighboring ETS and AP-1 transcription factor binding sites is enriched near cell migration genes activated by RAS/ERK signaling in epithelial cells. In vivo screening of candidate ETS proteins revealed that ETS1 is specifically required for migration of RAS/ERK activated cells. Furthermore, both migration and transcriptional activation through ETS/AP-1 required ERK phosphorylation of ETS1. Genome-wide mapping of multiple ETS proteins demonstrated that ETS1 binds specifically to enhancer ETS/AP-1 sequences. ETS1 occupancy, and its role in cell migration, was conserved in epithelial cells derived from multiple tissues, consistent with a chromatin organization common to epithelial cell lines. Genome-wide expression analysis showed that ETS1 was required for activation of RAS-regulated cell migration genes, but also identified a surprising role for ETS1 in the repression of genes such as DUSP4, DUSP6 and SPRY4 that provide negative feedback to the RAS/ERK pathway. Consistently, ETS1 was required for robust RAS/ERK pathway activation. Therefore, ETS1 has dual roles in mediating epithelial-specific RAS/ERK transcriptional functions. The Author(s) 2014.

abstract = {The potassium channel from Streptomyces lividans is an integral membrane protein with sequence similarity to all known K+ channels, particularly in the pore region. X-ray analysis with data to 3.2 angstroms reveals that four identical subunits create an inverted teepee, or cone, cradling the selectivity filter of the pore in its outer end. The narrow selectivity filter is only 12 angstroms long, whereas the remainder of the pore is wider and lined with hydrophobic amino acids. A large water-filled cavity and helix dipoles are positioned so as to overcome electrostatic destabilization of an ion in the pore at the center of the bilayer. Main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms from the K+ channel signature sequence line the selectivity filter, which is held open by structural constraints to coordinate K+ ions but not smaller Na+ ions. The selectivity filter contains two K+ ions about 7.5 angstroms apart. This configuration promotes ion conduction by exploiting electrostatic repulsive forces to overcome attractive forces between K+ ions and the selectivity filter. The architecture of the pore establishes the physical principles underlying selective K+ conduction.},

@article{Harrison1996,
abstract = {The iron storage protein, ferritin, plays a key role in iron metabolism. Its ability to sequester the element gives ferritin the dual functions of iron detoxification and iron reserve. The importance of these functions is emphasised by ferritin's ubiquitous distribution among living species. Ferritin's three-dimensional structure is highly conserved. All ferritins have 24 protein subunits arranged in 432 symmetry to give a hollow shell with an 80 {\AA} diameter cavity capable of storing up to 4500 Fe(III) atoms as an inorganic complex. Subunits are folded as 4-helix bundles each having a fifth short helix at roughly 60° to the bundle axis. Structural features of ferritins from humans, horse, bullfrog and bacteria are described: all have essentially the same architecture in spite of large variations in primary structure (amino acid sequence identities can be as low as 14{\%}) and the presence in some bacterial ferritins of haem groups. Ferritin molecules isolated from vertebrates are composed of two types of subunit (H and L), whereas those from plants and bacteria contain only H-type chains, where ‘H-type’ is associated with the presence of centres catalysing the oxidation of two Fe(II) atoms. The similarity between the dinuclear iron centres of ferritin H-chains and those of ribonucleotide reductase and other proteins suggests a possible wider evolutionary linkage. A great deal of research effort is now concentrated on two aspects of fenitin: its functional mechanisms and its regulation. These form the major part of the review. Steps in iron storage within ferritin molecules consist of Fe(II) oxidation, FE(III) migration and the nucleation and growth of the iron core mineral. H-chains are important for Fe(II) oxidation and L-chains assist in core formation. Iron mobilisation, relevant to ferritin's role as iron reserve, is also discussed. Translational regulation of mammalian ferritin synthesis in response to iron and the apparent links between iron and citrate metabolism through a single molecule with dual function are described. The molecule, when binding a 4Fe-4S] cluster, is a functioning (cytoplasmic) aconitase. When cellular iron is low, loss of the 4Fe-4S] cluster allows the molecule to bind to the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the ferritin m-RNA and thus to repress translation. In this form it is known as the iron regulatory protein (IRP) and the stem-loop RNA structure to which it binds is the iron regulatory element (IRE). IREs are found in the 3′-UTR of the transferrin receptor and in the 5′-UTR of erythroid aminolaevulinic acid synthase, enabling tight co-ordination between cellular iron uptake and the synthesis of ferritin and haem. Degradation of ferritin could potentially lead to an increase in toxicity due to uncontrolled release of iron. Degradation within membrane-encapsulated ‘secondary lysosomes’ may avoid this problem and this seems to be the origin of another form of storage iron known as haemosiderin. However, in certain pathological states, massive deposits of ‘haemosiderin’ are found which do not arise directly from ferritin breakdown. Understanding the numerous inter-relationships between the various intracellular iron complexes presents a major challenge.},

Study of the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-activated cation channel, which is modulated by calcium-calmodulin, indicates that calcium-calmodulin directly binds to a specific domain on the amino terminus of the channel. This binding reduces the effective affinity of the channel for cyclic nucleotides, apparently by acting on channel gating, which is tightly coupled to ligand binding. The data reveal a control mechanism that resembles those underlying the regulation of enzymes by calmodulin. The results also point to the amino-terminal part of the olfactory channel as an element for gating, which may have general significance in the operation of ion channels with similar overall structures.},

The pollen tube grows exclusively at its tip, and this growth is distinguished by very fast rates and reaches extended lengths. Thus, one of the most fascinating aspects of pollen biology is the question of how enough cell wall material is produced to accommodate such rapid extension of pollen tube, and how the cell wall deposition and structure are regulated to allow for rapid changes in the direction of growth. This review discusses recent advances in our understanding of the mechanism of pollen tube growth, focusing on such basic cellular processes as control of cell shape and growth by a network of cell wall-modifying enzymes, molecular motor-mediated vesicular transport, and intracellular signaling by localized gradients of second messengers. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Cyclic nucleotide-gated (cng) non-selective cation channels have been cloned from a number of animal systems. These channels are characterized by direct gating upon cAMP or cGMP binding to the intracellular portion of the channel protein, which leads to an increase in channel conductance. Animal cng channels are involved in signal transduction systems; they translate stimulus-induced changes in cytosolic cyclic nucleotide into altered cell membrane potential and/or cation flux as part of a signal cascade pathway. Putative plant homologs of animal cng channels have been identified. However, functional characterization (i.e. demonstration of cyclic-nucleotide-dependent ion currents) of a plant cng channel has not yet been accomplished. We report the cloning and first functional characterization of a plant member of this family of ion channels. The Arabidopsis cDNA AtCNGC2 encodes a polypeptide with deduced homology to the alpha-subunit of animal channels, and facilitates cyclic nucleotide-dependent cation currents upon expression in a number of heterologous systems. AtCNGC2 expression in a yeast mutant lacking a low-affinity K(+) uptake system complements growth inhibition only when lipophilic cyclic nucleotides are present in the culture medium. Voltage clamp analysis indicates that Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with AtCNGC2 cRNA demonstrate cyclic-nucleotide-dependent, inward-rectifying K(+) currents. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) transfected with AtCNGC2 cDNA demonstrate increased permeability to Ca(2+) only in the presence of lipophilic cyclic nucleotides. The evidence presented here supports the functional classification of AtCNGC2 as a cyclic-nucleotide-gated cation channel, and presents the first direct evidence (to our knowledge) identifying a plant member of this ion channel family.},

abstract = {Stem cell genetics research may be critical to our understanding of carcinogenesis, as both stem cells and cancer cells possess the ability to self-renew. Recent discoveries have indicated that the piwi family of genes plays an essential role in stem cell self-renewal in diverse organisms. The hiwi gene, the human homolog of the piwi family, participates in germ cell proliferation and its overexpression may cause the development of germ cell malignancy, but its expression and function in epithelial solid cancers have not been explored. In the present study, we investigated whether there was an association between hiwi expression and human gastric cancer and its potential mechanism. RT-PCR findings demonstrated that hiwi was expressed in different gastric cancer cell lines. To identify the HIWI protein in gastric cancer, we developed a specific monoclonal antibody against HIWI and immunohistochemistry was performed on various gastric tissues. We found that the expression ratio of hiwi in normal gastric tissues, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancers was 10{\%} (5/50), 36{\%} (18/50), 36{\%} (18/50) and 76{\%} (38/50), respectively, which was consistent with precancerous development. Notably, the expression pattern of hiwi in gastric cancer tissues was similar to that of Ki67, which was used as a marker of proliferation. Moreover, the suppression of hiwi by antisense or RNAi inhibited the growth of gastric cancer cells and induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. These results suggest that hiwi may be involved in the development of gastric cancer and is a potential target for cancer therapy.},

abstract = {The function of vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter(s) in plants has been studied primarily in the context of salinity tolerance. By facilitating the accumulation of Na+ away from the cytosol, plant cells can avert ion toxicity and also utilize vacuolar Na+ as osmoticum to maintain turgor. As many genes encoding these antiporters have been cloned from salt-sensitive plants, it is likely that they function in some capacity other than salinity tolerance. The wide expression pattern of Arabidopsis thaliana sodium proton exchanger 1 (AtNHX1) in this study supports this hypothesis. Here, we report the isolation of a T-DNA insertional mutant of AtNHX1, a vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter in Arabidopsis. Vacuoles isolated from leaves of the nhx1 plants had a much lower Na+/H+ and K+/H+ exchange activity. nhx1 plants also showed an altered leaf development, with reduction in the frequency of large epidermal cells and a reduction in overall leaf area compared to wild-type plants. The overexpression of AtNHX1 in the nhx1 background complemented these phenotypes. In the presence of NaCl, nhx1 seedling establishment was impaired. These results place AtNHX1 as the dominant K+ and Na+/H+ antiporter in leaf vacuoles in Arabidopsis and also suggest that its contribution to ion homeostasis is important for not only salinity tolerance but development as well.},

abstract = {The complexity of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells evolved to provide distinct environments to regulate processes necessary for cell proliferation and survival. A large family of predicted cation/proton exchangers (CHX), represented by 28 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, are associated with diverse endomembrane compartments and tissues in plants, although their roles are poorly understood. We expressed a phylogenetically related cluster of CHX genes, encoded by CHX15-CHX20, in yeast and bacterial cells engineered to lack multiple cation-handling mechanisms. Of these, CHX16-CHX20 were implicated in pH homeostasis because their expression rescued the alkaline pH-sensitive growth phenotype of the host yeast strain. A smaller subset, CHX17-CHX19, also conferred tolerance to hygromycin B. Further differences were observed in K(+)- and low pH-dependent growth phenotypes. Although CHX17 did not alter cytoplasmic or vacuolar pH in yeast, CHX20 elicited acidification and alkalization of the cytosol and vacuole, respectively. Using heterologous expression in Escherichia coli strains lacking K(+) uptake systems, we provide evidence for K(+) ((86)Rb) transport mediated by CHX17 and CHX20. Finally, we show that CHX17 and CHX20 affected protein sorting as measured by carboxypeptidase Y secretion in yeast mutants grown at alkaline pH. In plant cells, CHX20-RFP co-localized with an endoplasmic reticulum marker, whereas RFP-tagged CHX17-CHX19 co-localized with prevacuolar compartment and endosome markers. Together, these results suggest that in response to environmental cues, multiple CHX transporters differentially modulate K(+) and pH homeostasis of distinct intracellular compartments, which alter membrane trafficking events likely to be critical for adaptation and survival.},

abstract = {Gene duplication followed by adaptive evolution is one of the primary forces for the emergence of new gene function(1). Here we describe the recent proliferation, transposition and selection of a 20-kilobase (kb) duplicated segment throughout 15 Mb of the short arm of human chromosome 16. The dispersal of this segment was accompanied by considerable variation in chromosomal-map location and copy number among hominoid species. In humans, we identified a gene family (morpheus) within the duplicated segment. Comparison of putative protein-encoding exons revealed the most extreme case of positive selection among hominoids. The major episode of enhanced amino-acid replacement occurred after the separation of human and great-ape lineages from the orangutan. Positive selection continued to alter amino-acid composition after the divergence of human and chimpanzee lineages. The rapidity and bias for amino-acid-altering nucleotide changes suggest adaptive evolution of the morpheus gene family during the emergence of humans and African apes. Moreover, some genes emerge and evolve very rapidly, generating copies that bear little similarity to their ancestral precursors. Consequently, a small fraction of human genes may not possess discernible orthologues within the genomes of model organisms.},

abstract = {Mallotus s.str. is a monophyletic, large, palaeotropical genus in the family Euphorbiaccae. We investigated the phylogeny of the genus in order to (1) determine the evolutionary relationships within the Mallotus s.str. clade: (2) assess whether the six sections as circumscribed in the traditional classification reflect clades and evaluate the characters used in the classification: and (3) determine what are additonal new clades and their supporting morphological characters. For this purpose we assembled different datasets: plastid (matK) and nuclear (gpd) DNA sequence, macromorphological features and leaf anatomical data. We found that Mallotus sect. Mallotus, sect. Polyadenii and sect. Stylanthus are monophyletic. M. sect. Axenfeldia and sect. Rottleropsis are plyphyletic, and M. sect. Philippinenses is paraphyletic. Six additional clades with morphological synapomophies were also identified. An analysis of quantiative morphological data, in combination with quanlitative morphological and molecular dartasets resulted in almost completely resolved phylogenies and increased support values. However, the higher-level relationships between the clades are not supported in out analyses and the position of many taxa is still ambiguous.},

abstract = {The Arabidopsis tandem-pore K(+) (TPK) channels displaying four transmembrane domains and two pore regions share structural homologies with their animal counterparts of the KCNK family. In contrast to the Shaker-like Arabidopsis channels (six transmembrane domains/one pore region), the functional properties and the biological role of plant TPK channels have not been elucidated yet. Here, we show that AtTPK4 (KCO4) localizes to the plasma membrane and is predominantly expressed in pollen. AtTPK4 (KCO4) resembles the electrical properties of a voltage-independent K(+) channel after expression in Xenopus oocytes and yeast. Hyperpolarizing as well as depolarizing membrane voltages elicited instantaneous K(+) currents, which were blocked by extracellular calcium and cytoplasmic protons. Functional complementation assays using a K(+) transport-deficient yeast confirmed the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the AtTPK4 channel. The features of AtTPK4 point toward a role in potassium homeostasis and membrane voltage control of the growing pollen tube. Thus, AtTPK4 represents a member of plant tandem-pore-K(+) channels, resembling the characteristics of its animal counterparts as well as plant-specific features with respect to modulation of channel activity by acidosis and calcium.},

The channels encoded by KAT1 are highly selective for K+ over other monovalent cations, are blocked by tetraethylammonium and barium, and have a single channel conductance of 28 +/- 7 picosiemens with 118 millimolar K+ in the bathing solution. These functional characteristics, typical of inward-rectifying K+ channels in eukaryotic cells, demonstrate that KAT1 encodes an inward-rectifying K+ channel.},

abstract = {The SNARE (for soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor protein attachment protein receptor) protein SYP121 (=SYR1/PEN1) of Arabidopsis thaliana facilitates vesicle traffic, delivering ion channels and other cargo to the plasma membrane, and contributing to plant cell expansion and defense. Recently, we reported that SYP121 also interacts directly with the K(+) channel subunit KC1 and forms a tripartite complex with a second K(+) channel subunit, AKT1, to control channel gating and K(+) transport. Here, we report isolating a minimal sequence motif of SYP121 prerequisite for its interaction with KC1. We made use of yeast mating-based split-ubiquitin and in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays for protein-protein interaction and of expression and electrophysiological analysis. The results show that interaction of SYP121 with KC1 is associated with a novel FxRF motif uniquely situated within the first 12 residues of the SNARE sequence, that this motif is the minimal requirement for SNARE-dependent alterations in K(+) channel gating when heterologously expressed, and that rescue of KC1-associated K(+) current of the root epidermis in syp121 mutant Arabidopsis plants depends on expression of SNARE constructs incorporating this motif. These results establish the FxRF sequence as a previously unidentified motif required for SNARE-ion channel interactions and lead us to suggest a mechanistic framework for understanding the coordination of vesicle traffic with transmembrane ion transport.},

NSCCs do not, or only to a small extent, select between monovalent cations, and several are also permeable to divalent cations. Although a number of NSCC genes has been identified in plant genomes, a direct correlation between gene products and in vivo observed currents is still largely absent for most NSCCs. In this review, physiological functions and molecular properties of NSCCs are critically discussed. Recent studies have demonstrated that NSCCs are directly involved in a multitude of stress responses, growth and development, uptake of nutrients and calcium signalling. NSCCs can also function in the perception of external stimuli and as signal transducers for reactive oxygen species, pathogen elicitors, cyclic nucleotides, membrane stretch, amino acids and purines.},

abstract = {To compare vulva development mechanisms in the nematode Oscheius sp. 1 to those known in Caenorhabditis elegans, we performed a genetic screen for vulva mutants in Oscheius sp. 1 CEW1. Here we present one large category of mutations that we call cov, which affect the specification of the Pn.p ventral epidermal cells along the antero-posterior axis. The Pn.p cells are numbered from 1 to 12 from anterior to posterior. In wild-type Oscheius sp. 1 CEW1, the P(4-8).p cells are competent to form the vulva and the progeny of P(5-7).p actually form the vulva, with the descendants of P6.p adopting a central vulval fate. Among the 17 mutations (defining 13 genes) that we characterize here, group 1 mutations completely or partially abolish P(4-8).p competence, and this correlates with early fusion of the Pn.p cells to the epidermal syncytium. In this group, we found a putative null mutation in the lin-39 HOM-C homolog, the associated phenotype of which could be weakly mimicked by injection of a morpholino against Osp1-lin-39 in the mother's germ line. Using cell ablation in a partially penetrant competence mutant, we show that vulval competence is partially controlled by a gonadal signal. Most other mutants found in the screen display phenotypes unknown in C. elegans. Group 2 mutants show a partial penetrance of Pn.p competence loss and an abnormal centering of the vulva on P5.p, suggesting that these two processes are coregulated by the same pathway in Oscheius sp. 1. Group 3 mutants display an enlarged competence group that includes P3.p, thus demonstrating the existence of a specific mechanism inhibiting P3.p competence. Group 4 mutants display an abnormal centering of the vulval pattern on P7.p and suggest that a specific mechanism centers the vulval pattern on a single Pn.p cell.},

abstract = {Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing can join exons contained on either a single pre-mRNA (cis) or on separate pre-mRNAs (trans). It is exceedingly rare to have trans-splicing between protein-coding exons and has been demonstrated for only two Drosophila genes: mod(mdg4) and lola. It has also been suggested that trans-splicing is a mechanism for the generation of chimeric RNA products containing sequence from multiple distant genomic sites. Because most high-throughput approaches cannot distinguish cis- and trans-splicing events, the extent to which trans-splicing occurs between protein-coding exons in any organism is unknown. Here, we used paired-end deep sequencing of mRNA to identify genes that undergo trans-splicing in Drosophila interspecies hybrids. We did not observe credible evidence for the existence of chimeric RNAs generated by trans-splicing of RNAs transcribed from distant genomic loci. Rather, our data suggest that experimental artifacts are the source of most, if not all, apparent chimeric RNA products. We did, however, identify 80 genes that appear to undergo trans-splicing between homologous alleles and can be classified into three categories based on their organization: (i) genes with multiple 3' terminal exons, (ii) genes with multiple first exons, and (iii) genes with very large introns, often containing other genes. Our results suggest that trans-splicing between homologous alleles occurs more commonly in Drosophila than previously believed and may facilitate expression of architecturally complex genes.},

abstract = {Sexual reproduction in plants requires elongation of the pollen tube through the transmitting tissues toward the ovary. Tube growth rate is a major determinant of pollen competitive ability. We report that a K(+) channel of the Shaker family in Arabidopsis, SPIK, plays an important role in pollen tube development. SPIK was found to be specifically expressed in pollen. When SPIK was heterologously expressed in COS cells, its product formed hyperpolarization-activated K(+) channels. Disruption (T-DNA insertion) of the SPIK coding sequence strongly affected inwardly rectifying K(+)-channel activity in the pollen-grain plasma membrane. Measurements of membrane potential in growing pollen tubes yielded data compatible with a contribution of SPIK to K(+) influx. In vitro pollen germination assays were performed, revealing that the disruption results in impaired pollen tube growth. Analysis of the transmission rate of the disrupted allele in the progeny of heterozygous plants revealed a decrease in pollen competitive ability, the probability of fertilization by mutant pollen being approximately 1.6 times lower than that by wild-type pollen. The whole set of data supports the hypothesis that functional expression of SPIK plays a role in K(+) uptake in the growing pollen tube, and thereby in tube development and pollen competitive ability.},

abstract = {Elevations in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) constitute a fundamental signal transduction mechanism in eukaryotic cells, but the molecular identity of Ca(2+) channels initiating this signal in plants is still under debate. Here, we show by pharmacology and loss-of-function mutants that in tobacco and Arabidopsis, glutamate receptor-like channels (GLRs) facilitate Ca(2+) influx across the plasma membrane, modulate apical [Ca(2+)](cyt) gradient, and consequently affect pollen tube growth and morphogenesis. Additionally, wild-type pollen tubes grown in pistils of knock-out mutants for serine-racemase (SR1) displayed growth defects consistent with a decrease in GLR activity. Our findings reveal a novel plant signaling mechanism between male gametophyte and pistil tissue similar to amino acid-mediated communication commonly observed in animal nervous systems.},

Mkt1 and 2, Arabidopsis AKT homologs, and Kmt1, a KAT homolog, are members of small gene families with two to three isoforms each. Mkt1 is root specific; Mkt2 is found in leaves, flowers, and seed capsules; and Kmt1 is expressed in leaves and seed capsules. Mkt1 is present in all cells of the root, and in leaves a highly conserved isoform is detected present in all cells with highest abundance in the vasculature. MKT1 for which antibodies were made is localized to the plasma membrane. Following salt stress, MKT1 (transcripts and protein) is drastically down-regulated, Mkt2 transcripts do not change significantly, and Kmt1 is strongly and transiently (maximum at 6 h) up-regulated in leaves and stems. The detection and stress-dependent behavior of abundant transcripts representing subfamilies of potassium channels provides information about tissue specificity and the complex regulation of genes encoding potassium uptake systems in a halophytic plant.},

abstract = {The purple kale (Brassica Oleracea var. acephala f. tricolor) is a mutation in kales, giving the mutant phenotype of brilliant purple color in the interior. Total anthocyanin analysis showed that the amount of anthocyanins in the purple kale was up to 1.73 mg g(-1) while no anthocyanin was detected in the white kale. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the anthocyanin biosynthesis in the purple kale, we analyzed the expression of structural genes and some transcription factors associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis in the purple cultivar "Red Dove" and the white cultivar "White Dove". The result showed that nearly all the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes showed higher expression levels in the purple cultivar than in the white cultivar, especially for DFR and ANS, they were barely detected in the white cultivar. Interestingly, the fact that a R2R3 MYB transcription factor named BoPAP1 was extremely up-regulated in the purple kale and induced by low temperature attracted our attention. Further sequence analysis showed that BoPAP1 shared high similarity with AtPAP1 and BoMYB1. In addition, the anthocyanin accumulation in the purple kale is strongly induced by the low temperature stress. The total anthocyanin contents in the purple kale under low temperature were about 50-fold higher than the plants grown in the greenhouse. The expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes C4H, F3H, DFR, ANS and UFGT were all enhanced under the low temperature. These evidences strongly suggest that BoPAP1 may play an important role in activating the anthocyanin structural genes for the abundant anthocyanin accumulation in the purple kale.},

abstract = {A new perspective on the topic of antibiotic resistance is beginning to emerge based on a broader evolutionary and ecological understanding rather than from the traditional boundaries of clinical research of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. Phylogenetic insights into the evolution and diversity of several antibiotic resistance genes suggest that at least some of these genes have a long evolutionary history of diversification that began well before the 'antibiotic era'. Besides, there is no indication that lateral gene transfer from antibiotic-producing bacteria has played any significant role in shaping the pool of antibiotic resistance genes in clinically relevant and commensal bacteria. Most likely, the primary antibiotic resistance gene pool originated and diversified within the environmental bacterial communities, from which the genes were mobilized and penetrated into taxonomically and ecologically distant bacterial populations, including pathogens. Dissemination and penetration of antibiotic resistance genes from antibiotic producers were less significant and essentially limited to other high G+C bacteria. Besides direct selection by antibiotics, there is a number of other factors that may contribute to dissemination and maintenance of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial populations.},

abstract = {The resistance of Candida albicans to many stresses is dependent on the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) Hog1. Hence we have explored the role of Hog1 in the regulation of transcriptional responses to stress. DNA microarrays were used to characterize the global transcriptional responses of HOG1 and hog1 cells to three stress conditions that activate the Hog1 SAPK: osmotic stress, oxidative stress, and heavy metal stress. This revealed both stress-specific transcriptional responses and a core transcriptional response to stress in C. albicans. The core transcriptional response was characterized by a subset of genes that responded in a stereotypical manner to all of the stresses analyzed. Inactivation of HOG1 significantly attenuated transcriptional responses to osmotic and heavy metal stresses, but not to oxidative stress, and this was reflected in the role of Hog1 in the regulation of C. albicans core stress genes. Instead, the Cap1 transcription factor plays a key role in the oxidative stress regulation of C. albicans core stress genes. Our data show that the SAPK network in C. albicans has diverged from corresponding networks in model yeasts and that the C. albicans SAPK pathway functions in parallel with other pathways to regulate the core transcriptional response to stress.},

abstract = {Potassium (K(+)) is a major plant nutrient required for growth and development. It is generally accepted that plant roots absorb K(+) through uptake systems operating at low concentrations (high-affinity transport) and/or high external concentrations (low-affinity transport). To understand the molecular basis of high-affinity K(+) uptake in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), we analyzed loss-of-function mutants in AtHAK5 and AKT1, two transmembrane proteins active in roots. Compared with the wild type under NH(4)(+)-free growth conditions, athak5 mutant plants exhibited growth defects at 10 mum K(+), but at K(+) concentrations of 20 mum and above, athak5 mutants were visibly indistinguishable from the wild type. While germination, scored as radicle emergence, was only slightly decreased in athak5 akt1 double mutants on low-K(+) medium, double mutants failed to grow on medium containing up to 100 mum K(+) and growth was impaired at concentrations up to 450 mum K(+). Moreover, transfer of 3-d-old plants from high to low K(+) concentrations led to growth defects and leaf chlorosis at 10 mum K(+) in athak5 akt1 double mutant plants. Determination of Rb(+)(K(+)) uptake kinetics in wild-type and mutant roots using rubidium ((86)Rb(+)) as a tracer for K(+) revealed that high-affinity Rb(+)(K(+)) uptake into roots is almost completely abolished in double mutants and impaired in single mutants. These results strongly indicate that AtHAK5 and AKT1 are the two major, physiologically relevant molecular entities mediating high-affinity K(+) uptake into roots during seedling establishment and postgermination growth and that residual Rb(+)(K(+)) uptake measured in athak5 akt1 double mutant roots is insufficient to enable plant growth.},

It is, therefore, important to understand the structure of p53 and how it responds to mutation, so as to predict the phenotypic response and cancer prognosis. In this review, we present recent structural and systematic functional data that elucidate the molecular basis of how p53 is inactivated by different types of cancer mutation. Intriguingly, common cancer mutants exhibit a variety of distinct local structural changes, while the overall structural scaffold is largely preserved. The diverse structural and energetic response to mutation determines: (i) the folding state of a particular mutant under physiological conditions; (ii) its affinity for the various p53 target DNA sequences; and (iii) its protein-protein interactions both within the p53 tetramer and with a multitude of regulatory proteins. Further, the structural details of individual mutants provide the basis for the design of specific and generic drugs for cancer therapy purposes. In combination with studies on second-site suppressor mutations, it appears that some mutants are ideal rescue candidates, whereas for others simple pharmacological rescue by small molecule drugs may not be successful.},

abstract = {The trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP) assembles into an 11-fold symmetric ring that regulates transcription and translation of trp-mRNA in bacilli via heterotropic allosteric activation by the amino acid tryptophan (Trp). Whereas nuclear magnetic resonance studies have revealed that Trp-induced activation coincides with both microsecond to millisecond rigidification and local structural changes in TRAP, the pathway of binding of the 11 Trp ligands to the TRAP ring remains unclear. Moreover, because each of 11 bound Trp molecules is completely surrounded by protein, its release requires flexibility of Trp-bound (holo) TRAP. Here, we used stopped-flow fluorescence to study the kinetics of Trp binding by Bacillus stearothermophilus TRAP over a range of temperatures and observed well-separated kinetic steps. These data were analyzed using nonlinear least-squares fitting of several two- and three-step models. We found that a model with two binding steps best describes the data, although the structural equivalence of the binding sites in TRAP implies a fundamental change in the time-dependent structure of the TRAP rings upon Trp binding. Application of the two-binding step model reveals that Trp binding is much slower than the diffusion limit, suggesting a gating mechanism that depends on the dynamics of apo TRAP. These data also reveal that dissociation of Trp from the second binding mode is much slower than after the first Trp binding mode, revealing insight into the mechanism for positive homotropic allostery, or cooperativity. Temperature-dependent analyses reveal that both binding modes imbue increases in bondedness and order toward a more compressed active state. These results provide insight into mechanisms of cooperative TRAP activation and underscore the importance of protein dynamics for ligand binding, ligand release, protein activation, and allostery.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We report here that the inward-rectifying potassium channels KAT1 and AKT2 were functionally expressed in K+ uptake-deficient Escherichia coli. Immunological assays showed that KAT1 was translocated into the cell membrane of E. coli. Functional assays suggested that KAT1 was inserted topologically correctly into the cell membrane. In control experiments, the inactive point mutation in KAT1, T256R, did not complement for K+ uptake in E. coli. The inward-rectifying K+ channels of plants share a common hydrophobic domain comprising at least six membrane-spanning segments (S1-S6). The finding that a K+ channel can be expressed in bacteria was further exploited to determine the KAT1 membrane topology by a gene fusion approach using the bacterial reporter enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, which is active only in the periplasm, and beta-galactosidase. The enzyme activity from the alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase fusion plasmid showed that the widely predicted S1, S2, S5, and S6 segments were inserted into the membrane. Although the S3 segment in the alkaline phosphatase fusion protein could not function as an export signal, the replacement of a negatively charged residue inside S3 with a neutral amino acid resulted in an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, which indicates that the alkaline phosphatase was translocated into the periplasm. For membrane translocation of S3, the neutralization of a negatively charged residue in S3 may be required presumably because of pairing with a positively charged residue of S4. These results revealed that KAT1 has the common six transmembrane-spanning membrane topology that has been predicted for the Shaker superfamily of voltage-dependent K+ channels. Furthermore, the functional complementation of a bacterial K+ uptake mutant in this study is shown to be an alternative expression system for plant K+ channel proteins and a potent tool for their topological analysis.},

abstract = {Male solitary animals frequently enter aggressive interactions with conspecific individuals to protect their territory or to gain access to females. After an agonistic encounter, the loser (subordinate individual) changes its behaviour from aggression to avoidance. We investigated agonistic interactions between pairs of male crickets to understand how dominance is established and maintained. Two naive males readily entered into agonistic interactions. Fights escalated in a stereotyped manner and were concluded with the establishment of dominance. If individuals were isolated after the first encounter and placed together 15 minutes later, subordinate crickets tended to avoid any further contact with the former dominant opponent. Moreover, subordinate males also avoided unfamiliar dominant and naive opponents. They displayed aggressive behaviour only towards unfamiliar subordinate opponents. This suggests that the subordinate male change their behaviour depending on the dominance status of the opponent. Dominant crickets, in contrast, displayed aggressive behaviour towards familiar as well as unfamiliar opponents. If the interval between the first and second encounter was longer than 30 minutes, the former subordinate male showed aggressive behaviour again. However, if the subordinate cricket was paired with the same opponent three consecutive times within 45 minutes, it avoided the former dominant opponent for up to 6 hours following the third encounter. Our results suggest that the maintenance of dominance in male crickets depends largely on the behavioural change of subordinate individuals. Possible mechanisms to maintain dominance are discussed.},

Most of the cloned genes for the -subunits are classified into four subfamilies: Kv1 (Shaker), Kv2 (Shab), Kv3 (Shaw), and Kv4 (Shal). Subfamily-specific assembly of heteromeric K+ channel complexes has been observed in vitro and in vivo, which contributes to the diversity of K+ currents. However, the molecular codes that mediate the subfamily-specific association remain unknown. To understand the molecular basis of the subfamily-specific assembly, we tested the protein-protein interactions of different regions of -subunits. We report here that the cytoplasmic NH[IMG]/medium/tiny{\_}2.gif" ALT="Formula ">-terminal domains of Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, and Kv4 subfamilies each associate to form homomultimers.

abstract = {The growing pollen tube provides an excellent single cell model system in which to study the mechanisms determining growth regulation, polarity and periodic behaviour. Previously, using FM4-64, we identified periodic movements within the apical vesicle accumulation that were related to the period of oscillatory growth. This suggested a more complex interdependence between membrane traffic, apical extension and periodicity than previously thought. To investigate this a comparison was made between normally growing and Brefeldin-A-treated, non-growing, tubes. Brefeldin-A treatment established an intriguing, stable yet dynamic system of membrane aggregations in the pollen tube tip that exhibited regular movements of material with a 5-7 second period compared with the normal approximately 30 second periodicity observed in growing tubes. Heat treatment was found to reduce period length in both cases. After BFA treatment membrane was demonstrated to flow from the extreme pollen tube apex back through a distinct subapical Brefeldin-A-induced membrane accumulation. The effects of Brefeldin-A on the distribution of ER- and Golgi-targeted fluorescent proteins revealed that ER did not contribute directly to the system of membrane aggregations while only certain compartments of the Golgi might be involved. The involvement of membrane derived from the apical vesicle accumulation was strongly implicated. Calcium measurements revealed that Brefeldin-A abolished the typical tip-focused calcium gradient associated with growth and there were no obvious periodic fluctuations in apical calcium associated with the continued periodic Brefeldin-A membrane aggregation associated movements. Our experiments reveal an underlying periodicity in the pollen tube that is independent of secretion, apical extension and the oscillating tip-focused calcium gradient normally associated with growth, but requires an active actin cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A Xist RNA decorated Barr body is the structural hallmark of the compacted inactive X territory in female mammals. Using super-resolution three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) and quantitative image analysis, we compared its ultrastructure with active chromosome territories (CTs) in human and mouse somatic cells, and explored the spatio-temporal process of Barr body formation at onset of inactivation in early differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs).

RESULTS: We demonstrate that all CTs are composed of structurally linked chromatin domain clusters (CDCs). In active CTs the periphery of CDCs harbors low-density chromatin enriched with transcriptionally competent markers, called the perichromatin region (PR). The PR borders on a contiguous channel system, the interchromatin compartment (IC), which starts at nuclear pores and pervades CTs. We propose that the PR and macromolecular complexes in IC channels together form the transcriptionally permissive active nuclear compartment (ANC). The Barr body differs from active CTs by a partially collapsed ANC with CDCs coming significantly closer together, although a rudimentary IC channel system connected to nuclear pores is maintained. Distinct Xist RNA foci, closely adjacent to the nuclear matrix scaffold attachment factor-A (SAF-A) localize throughout Xi along the rudimentary ANC. In early differentiating ESCs initial Xist RNA spreading precedes Barr body formation, which occurs concurrent with the subsequent exclusion of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). Induction of a transgenic autosomal Xist RNA in a male ESC triggers the formation of an 'autosomal Barr body' with less compacted chromatin and incomplete RNAP II exclusion.

CONCLUSIONS: 3D-SIM provides experimental evidence for profound differences between the functional architecture of transcriptionally active CTs and the Barr body. Basic structural features of CT organization such as CDCs and IC channels are however still recognized, arguing against a uniform compaction of the Barr body at the nucleosome level. The localization of distinct Xist RNA foci at boundaries of the rudimentary ANC may be considered as snap-shots of a dynamic interaction with silenced genes. Enrichment of SAF-A within Xi territories and its close spatial association with Xist RNA suggests their cooperative function for structural organization of Xi.},

It continues clockwise in Hind K, where it terminates with a UAA signal. The latter is located 110 nucleotides beyond the initiation signal for the major structural protein VP1 (Fiers et al., 1975; Van de Voorde et al., 1976).
