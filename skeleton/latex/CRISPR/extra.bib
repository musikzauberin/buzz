abstract = {The clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) system from Streptococcus pyogenes (Spy) has been successfully adapted for RNA-guided genome editing in a wide range of organisms. However, numerous reports have indicated that Spy CRISPR-Cas9 systems may have significant off-target cleavage of genomic DNA sequences differing from the intended on-target site. Here, we report the performance of the Neisseria meningitidis (Nme) CRISPR-Cas9 system that requires a longer protospacer-adjacent motif for site-specific cleavage, and present a comparison between the Spy and Nme CRISPR-Cas9 systems targeting the same protospacer sequence. The results with the native crRNA and tracrRNA as well as a chimeric single guide RNA for the Nme CRISPR-Cas9 system were also compared. Our results suggest that, compared with the Spy system, the Nme CRISPR-Cas9 system has similar or lower on-target cleavage activity but a reduced overall off-target effect on a genomic level when sites containing three or fewer mismatches are considered. Thus, the Nme CRISPR-Cas9 system may represent a safer alternative for precision genome engineering applications.},

@article{OGeen2015,
abstract = {The specificity of RNA-guided nucleases has gathered considerable interest as they become broadly applied to basic research and therapeutic development. Reports of the simple generation of animal models and genome engineering of cells raised questions about targeting precision. Conflicting early reports led the field to believe that CRISPR/Cas9 system was promiscuous, leading to a variety of strategies for improving specificity and increasingly sensitive methods to detect off-target events. However, other studies have suggested that CRISPR/Cas9 is a highly specific genome-editing tool. This review will focus on deciphering and interpreting these seemingly opposing claims.},

abstract = {CRISPR-Cas-mediated genome editing relies on guide RNAs that direct site-specific DNA cleavage facilitated by the Cas endonuclease. Here we report that chemical alterations to synthesized single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) enhance genome editing efficiency in human primary T cells and CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Co-delivering chemically modified sgRNAs with Cas9 mRNA or protein is an efficient RNA- or ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-based delivery method for the CRISPR-Cas system, without the toxicity associated with DNA delivery. This approach is a simple and effective way to streamline the development of genome editing with the potential to accelerate a wide array of biotechnological and therapeutic applications of the CRISPR-Cas technology.},

@article{Gilles2014,
abstract = {Developmental biology, as all experimental science, is empowered by technological advances. The availability of genetic tools in some species - designated as model organisms - has driven their use as major platforms for understanding development, physiology and behavior. Extending these tools to a wider range of species determines whether (and how) we can experimentally approach developmental diversity and evolution. During the last two decades, comparative developmental biology (evo-devo) was marked by the introduction of gene knockdown and deep sequencing technologies that are applicable to a wide range of species. These approaches allowed us to test the developmental role of specific genes in diverse species, to study biological processes that are not accessible in established models and, in some cases, to conduct genome-wide screens that overcome the limitations of the candidate gene approach. The recent discovery of CRISPR/Cas as a means of precise alterations into the genome promises to revolutionize developmental genetics. In this review we describe the development of gene editing tools, from zinc-finger nucleases to TALENs and CRISPR, and examine their application in gene targeting, their limitations and the opportunities they present for evo-devo. We outline their use in gene knock-out and knock-in approaches, and in manipulating gene functions by directing molecular effectors to specific sites in the genome. The ease-of-use and efficiency of CRISPR in diverse species provide an opportunity to close the technology gap that exists between established model organisms and emerging genetically-tractable species.},

abstract = {CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing platforms are widely applied as powerful tools in basic research and potential therapeutics for genome regulation. The appropriate alternative of delivery system is critical if genome editing systems are to be effectively performed in the targeted cells or organisms. To date, the in vivo delivery of the Cas9 system remains challenging. Both physical methods and viral vectors are adopted in the delivery of the Cas9-based gene editing platform. However, physical methods are more applicable for in vitro delivery, while viral vectors are generally concerned with safety issues, limited packing capacities, and so on. With the robust development of nonviral drug delivery systems, lipid- or polymer-based nanocarriers might be potent vectors for the delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 systems. In this review, we look back at the delivery approaches that have been used for the delivery of the Cas9 system and outline the recent development of nonviral vectors that might be potential carriers for the genome editing platform in the future. The efforts in optimizing cationic nanocarriers with structural modification are described and promising nonviral vectors under clinical investigations are highlighted.},
