	Abstract = {In vitro co-culture system consisting of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) or mesenchymal stromal cell lines of marrow origin has provided important clues about the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by their microenvironment or niche. In the current studies, we have compared phenotypic and functional characters of a marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell line, M210B4, with BMSCs. We demonstrate that M210B4 resembles BMSCs in terms of phenotypic characters. Unlike the BMSCs, M210B4 differentiated only towards adipogenic lineage, and was refractory towards osteogenic differentiation. However, M210B4 cells exhibited a higher HSC-supportive ability as assessed by flow cytometry analyses of the output cells from co-cultures. We observed that M210B4 cells show a constitutively higher activation of p44/42 and p-38 MAPK pathways compared to BMSCs, contributing to their higher HSC-support in vitro. Overall, the results show that M210B4 forms a suitable in vitro system to study HSC regulation in vitro.},

	Abstract = {To enhance the understanding of differentiation patterns and bone formation capacity of hESCs, we determined (1) the temporal pattern of osteoblastic differentiation of human embryonic stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hESC-MSCs), (2) the influence of a three-dimensional matrix on the osteogenic differentiation of hESC-MSCs in long-term culture, and (3) the bone-forming capacity of osteoblast-like cells derived from hESC-MSCs in calvarial defects. Incubation of hESC-MSCs in osteogenic medium induced osteoblastic differentiation of hESC-MSCs into mature osteoblasts in a similar chronological pattern to human bone marrow stromal cells and primary osteoblasts. Osteogenic differentiation was enhanced by culturing the cells on three-dimensional collagen scaffolds. Fluorescent-activated cell sorting of alkaline phosphatase expressing cells was used to obtain an enriched osteogenic cell population for in vivo transplantation. The identification of green fluorescence protein and expression of human-specific nuclear antigen in osteocytes in newly formed bone verified the role of transplanted human cells in the bone regeneration process. The current cell culture model and osteogenic cell enrichment method could provide large numbers of osteoprogenitor cells for analysis of differentiation patterns and cell transplantation to regenerate skeletal defects.},

	Abstract = {The standard procedure for the osteogenic differentiation of multipotent stem cells is treatment of a confluent monolayer with a cocktail of dexamethasone (Dex), ascorbic acid (Asc) and $\beta$-glycerophosphate ($\beta$-Gly). This review describes the effects of these substances on intracellular signaling cascades that lead to osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stroma-derived stem cells. We conclude that Dex induces Runx2 expression by FHL2/$\beta$-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation and that Dex enhances Runx2 activity by upregulation of TAZ and MKP1. Asc leads to the increased secretion of collagen type I (Col1), which in turn leads to increased Col1/$\alpha$2$\beta$1 integrin-mediated intracellular signaling. The phosphate from $\beta$-Gly serves as a source for the phosphate in hydroxylapatite and in addition influences intracellular signaling molecules. In this context we give special attention to the differences between dystrophic and bone-specific mineralization. {\textcopyright} 2013 Bio Med Central Ltd.},

@article{Castren2015,
	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been intensely studied for the purpose of developing solutions for clinical tissue engineering. Autologous MSCs can potentially be used to replace tissue defects, but the procedure also carries risks such as immunization and xenogeneic infection. Replacement of the commonly used fetal calf serum (FCS) with human platelet lysate and plasma (PLP) to support cell growth may reduce some of these risks. Altered media could, however, influence stem cell differentiation and we address this experimentally.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We examined human MSC differentiation into the osteoblast lineage using in vitro two- and three-dimensional cultures with PLP or FCS as cell culture medium supplements. Differentiation was followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and alkaline phosphatase activity, matrix formation and matrix calcium content were quantified.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Three-dimensional culture, where human MSCs were grown on collagen sponges, markedly stimulated osteoblast differentiation; a fourfold increase in calcium deposition could be observed in both PLP and FCS groups. PLP-grown cells showed robust osteogenic differentiation both in two- and three-dimensional MSC cultures. The calcium content of the matrix in the two-dimensional PLP group at day 14 was 2.2-fold higher in comparison to the FCS group (p {\textless} 0.0001), and at day 21 it was still 1.3-fold higher (p {\textless} 0.001), suggesting earlier calcium accumulation to the matrix in the PLP group. This was supported by stronger Alizarin Red staining in the PLP group at day 14. In two-dimesional PLP cultures, cellular proliferation appeared to decrease during later stages of differentiation, while in the FCS group the number of cells increased throughout the experiment. In three-dimensional experiments, the PLP and FCS groups behaved more congruently, except for the alkaline phosphatase activity and mRNA levels which were markedly increased by PLP.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Human PLP was at least equal to FCS in supporting osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs in two- and three-dimensional conditions; however, proliferation was inferior. As PLP is free of animal components, and thus represents reduced risk for xenogeneic infection, its use for human MSC-induced bone repair in the clinic by the three-dimensional live implants presented here appears a promising therapy option.},

@article{Otsuka1999,
	Abstract = {The stromal cell line ST2, derived from mouse bone marrow, differentiated into osteoblast-like cells in response to ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid induced alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) activity, the expression of mRNAs for proteins that are markers of osteoblastic differentiation, the deposition of calcium, and the formation of mineralized nodules by ST2 cells. We investigated the mechanism whereby ascorbic acid induced the differentiation of ST2 cells. Inhibitors of the formation of collagen triple helices completely blocked the effects of ascorbic acid on ST2 cells, an indication that matrix formation by type I collagen is essential for the induction of osteoblastic differentiation of ST2 cells by ascorbic acid. We furthermore examined the effects of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) on the differentiation of ST2 cells induced by ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid had no effect on the expression of mRNAs for BMP-4 and the BMP receptors. However, a soluble form of BMP receptor IA inhibited the induction of ALPase activity by ascorbic acid. These results suggest that ascorbic acid might promote the differentiation of ST2 cells into osteoblast-like cells by inducing the formation of a matrix of type I collagen, with subsequent activation of the signaling pathways that involve BMPs.$\backslash$n},

	Abstract = {Dexamethasone (Dex) has been shown to induce osteoblast differentiation in several cell culture systems. This study investigated the effect of continuous and discontinuous treatment with Dex on osteoblast differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). Primary culture and first passage were cultured in media with or without Dex 10(-7) M. During the culture period, cells were incubated at 37 degrees C in humidified atmosphere of 5{\%} CO2 and 95{\%} air. At 7, 14, and 21 days, cell proliferation, cell viability, total protein content, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and bone-like formation were evaluated. Data were compared by two-way analysis of variance. Dex did not affect cell viability and total protein content, but reduced cell number. ALP activity and bone-like formation increased when only first passage or both primary culture and first passage were treated with Dex, in comparison to the groups that did not have contact with Dex after first passage. The results of this study indicate that, for human BMSC, continuous presence of Dex did not appear to be required for development of the osteoblast phenotype, but Dex must be present after first passage to allow osteoblast differentiation expressed by reduced cell proliferation and increased ALP activity and bone-like formation.},

@article{Mothersill1991,
	Abstract = {Normal urothelial cultures were established from transplant ureters and irradiated or exposed to nitrosamines. The cells which survived the treatment were monitored for expression of c-myc oncoprotein. The cultures were also exposed to tritiated thymidine (3HTdR) to determine the total number of cells synthesizing DNA. The area of explant outgrowth was also measured. Proliferation is considered to be a fundamental precondition which has to be present before malignant change can take place or which has to accompany this change. The results indicate that the overall growth rate of the carcinogen-treated cultures is relatively faster than that of the controls. This is particularly true one to two weeks after carcinogen exposure. Certain areas of the culture develop abnormally, cells are different in size and shape to the normal uroepithelial cell and have the capacity to pile up and form characteristic foci. These foci continue to proliferate after senescence of control cultures and after senescence of normal areas of treated cultures. The cells in these foci express high levels of c-Myc oncoprotein. Control and treated but normal cells are negative for this antigen under the conditions used. N-ethyl nitrosamine (NEN) (0.005-0.05 micrograms/ml) and radiation (2.5-10.0 Gy) are both able to induce the changes described. The results suggest that radiation and/or nitrosamine treatment can induce uroepithelial cells to divide at a faster rate than usual. Certain cells within this fast growing culture attain the capacity to pile up and acquire a different morphology. These cells do not senescence at the usual time and are c-myc positive. They may represent a subpopulation which has undergone some pre or early malignant changes.},

	Abstract = {Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) play a central role in the repair and regeneration of mesenchymal tissues. For tissue engineering of ligaments and tendons, both stimulation of cell proliferation and differentiation with increased expression of essential extracellular matrix proteins and cytoskeletal elements are desirable. This study analyzes the effect of low-dose (3 ng/mL) fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and high-dose FGF-2 (30 ng/mL) on proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine content, spectrophotometry), differentiation (transcription of collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, elastin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and vimentin, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and cell density and apoptosis (annexin V, fluorescence-activated cell sorting) of human BMSCs, and compares the results with those of a control group without FGF-2. Low-dose FGF-2 triggered a biphasic BMSC response: on day 7, cell proliferation reached its maximum and was significantly higher compared with the other groups. On days 14 or 28, collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, and alpha- smooth muscle actin mRNA expression was significantly enhanced in the presence of low-dose FGF-2. In contrast, high-dose FGF-2 did not stimulate differentiation or proliferation. Vimentin mRNA was expressed only in cultures with low-dose and high-dose FGF-2 after 14 and 28 days. Cell density was significantly higher in cultures with low-dose FGF-2 compared with the group with high-dose FGF-2 on days 7, 14, and 28. The apoptosis rate remained stable, at a rather high level, in all groups. Microscopic investigation of the cell cultures with low-dose FGF-2 showed more homogeneous, dense, fibroblast-like, spindle-shaped cells with long cell processes compared with cultures with high-dose, or no FGF-2. Low-dose FGF-2 may be useful for tissue engineering of ligaments and tendons by increasing BMSC proliferation and stimulating mRNA expression of specific extracellular matrix proteins and cytoskeletal elements.},

	Abstract = {Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) positively modulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. However, the mechanism(s) is not fully understood. Because the Wnt canonical pathway is important for bone homeostasis, this study focuses on modulation of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling using Fgf2(-/-) mice (FGF2 all isoforms ablated), both in the absence of endogenous FGF2 and in the presence of exogenous FGF2. This study demonstrates a role of endogenous FGF2 in bone formation through Wnt signaling. Specifically, mRNA expression for the canonical Wnt genes Wnt10b, Lrp6, and $\beta$-catenin was decreased significantly in Fgf2(-/-) bone marrow stromal cells during osteoblast differentiation. In addition, a marked reduction of Wnt10b and $\beta$-catenin protein expression was observed in Fgf2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, Fgf2(-/-) osteoblasts displayed marked reduction of inactive phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3$\beta$, a negative regulator of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway as well as a significant decrease of Dkk2 mRNA, which plays a role in terminal osteoblast differentiation. Addition of exogenous FGF2 promoted $\beta$-catenin nuclear accumulation and further partially rescued decreased mineralization in Fgf2(-/-) bone marrow stromal cell cultures. Collectively, our findings suggest that FGF2 stimulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation is mediated in part by modulating the Wnt pathway.},

@article{Sun2014,
	Abstract = {It is currently thought that life-long blood cell production is driven by the action of a small number of multipotent haematopoietic stem cells. Evidence supporting this view has been largely acquired through the use of functional assays involving transplantation. However, whether these mechanisms also govern native non-transplant haematopoiesis is entirely unclear. Here we have established a novel experimental model in mice where cells can be uniquely and genet-ically labelled in situ to address this question. Using this approach, we have performed longitudinal analyses of clonal dynamics in adult mice that reveal unprecedented features of native haematopoiesis. In contrast to what occurs follow-ing transplantation, steady-state blood production is maintained by the successive recruitment of thousands of clones, each with a minimal contribution to mature progeny. Our results demonstrate that a large number of long-lived pro-genitors, rather than classically defined haematopoietic stem cells, are the main drivers of steady-state haematopoiesis during most of adulthood. Our results also have implications for understanding the cellular origin of haematopoietic disease. Current dogma suggests that all haematolymphoid lineages are derived from a common ancestor, the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) 1,2 . During adult life, HSCs are thought to be the only bone marrow (BM) cell popu-lation capable of long-term self-renewal and multilineage differentia-tion 1,2 . As HSCs divide, they produce multipotent and lineage-restricted progenitor populations, which are regarded as transient intermediates before the final production of functional blood cells 1,2 . Historically, the main experimental approach used to elucidate and define the cellular properties of various BM populations has been the transplantation assay. In this assay, prospectively purified cell populations are transplanted into myeloablated hosts. A general caveat to these approaches, however, is that only cells that are able to circulate, colonize a niche, and prolif-erate rapidly, will be able to produce detectable progeny. Additionally, given the extraordinary stress that transplanted cells endure during engraftment and the distorted cytokine milieu that they encounter, it is questionable to what extent their functional characteristics are shared with cells driving more physiological non-transplant haematopoiesis. Recent fate tracking approaches have proven to be fundamental in determining biological properties and clonal dynamics of solid tissue stem cells 3,4},

ST-2 cells were cultured for 3-27 days in the presence of 10{\%} fetal bovine serum, 100 microg/mL ascorbic acid, and 5 mmol/L beta-glycerolphosphate in the presence or absence of cortisol at 1 micromol/L or BMP-2 at 1 nmol/L. Untreated ST-2 cells expressed high levels of alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) 15 days after confluence, and this was followed by the appearance of mineralized nodules after 24 days. BMP-2 accelerated and intensified the appearance of cells expressing APA and the presence of mineralized nodules. In contrast, cortisol decreased APA, prevented the formation of mineralized nodules, and induced a cellular phenotype characteristic of adipocytes. Untreated stromal cells expressed osteocalcin, Cbfa1, type I collagen, and alkaline phosphatase mRNA. BMP-2 increased osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase mRNA, whereas cortisol suppressed their expression, as well as Cbfa1 and type I collagen transcripts. Cortisol enhanced, and BMP-2 downregulated, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 and adipsin transcripts. The C/EBP transcription factors regulate genes critical for adipocytic and osteoblastic differentiation. Cortisol increased the expression of C/EBP alpha, beta, delta, and gamma mRNA levels, whereas BMP-2 had minor effects on C/EBP expression. In conclusion, BMP-2 accelerates the differentiation of stromal cells toward an osteoblastic phenotype, whereas glucocorticoids induce their differentiation toward an adipocytic phenotype.},

	Abstract = {Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) can differentiate into multiple lineages including osteogenic and adipogenic cells. Wnt signalling has been implicated in controlling BMSC fate, but the mechanisms are unclear and apparently conflicting data exist. Here we show that a novel glycogen synthase kinase 3?? inhibitor, AR28, is a potent activator of canonical Wnt signalling using in vitro ??-catenin translocation studies and TCF-reporter assays. In vivo, AR28 induced characteristic axis duplication and secondary regions of chordin expression in Xenopus laevis embryos.Using human BMSCs grown in adipogenic medium, we confirmed that AR28-mediated Wnt signalling caused a significant (p. {\textless}. 0.05) dose-dependent reduction of adipogenic markers. In osteogenic media, including dexamethasone, AR28 caused significant (p. {\textless}. 0.05) decreases in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity compared to vehicle controls, indicative of a reduced osteogenic response. However, when excluding dexamethasone from the osteogenic media, increases in both ALP and mineralisation were identified following AR28 treatment, which was blocked by mitomycin C. Pre-treatment of BMSCs with AR28 for 7. days before osteogenic induction also increased ALP activity and mineralisation. Furthermore, BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation was strongly enhanced by AR28 addition within 3. days, but without concomitant changes in cell number, therefore revealing BMP-dependent and independent mechanisms for Wnt-induced osteogenesis.?? 2013 .},

The hematopoietic stem cell, the common ancestor of all types of blood cells, is one of the best-characterized stem cells in the body and the only stem cell that is clinically applied in the treatment of diseases such as breast cancer, leukemias, and con- genital immunodeficiencies. Multicolor cell sorting enables the purification not only of hematopoietic stem cells, but also of their downstream progenitors such as common lymphoid progenitors and common myeloid progenitors. Recent genetic approaches including gene chip technology have been used to elucidate the gene expression pro- file of hematopoietic stem cells and other progenitors.

	Abstract = {Human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) are increasingly used in regenerative medicine for restoring worn-out or damaged tissue. Newly engineered tissues need to be properly vascularized and current candidates for in vitro tissue pre-vascularization are endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells. However, their use in therapy is hampered by their limited expansion capacity and lack of autologous sources. Our approach to engineering large grafts is to use hMSCs both as a source of cells for regeneration of targeted tissue and at the same time as the source of endothelial cells. Here we investigate how different stimuli influence endothelial differentiation of hMSCs. Although growth supplements together with shear force were not sufficient to differentiate hMSCs with respect to expression of endothelial markers such as CD31 and KDR, these conditions did prime the cells to differentiate into cells with an endothelial gene expression profile and morphology when seeded on Matrigel. In addition, we show that endothelial-like hMSCs are able to create a capillary network in 3D culture both in vitro and in vivo conditions. The expansion phase in the presence of growth supplements was crucial for the stability of the capillaries formed in vitro. To conclude, we established a robust protocol for endothelial differentiation of hMSCs, including an immortalized MSC line (iMSCs) which allows for reproducible in vitro analysis in further studies.},

	Abstract = {Significantly more primitive human hematopoietic progenitors are maintained and differentiate when cultured separately from the stroma by a microporous membrane ('stroma-noncontact' cultures) than when cultured in direct contact with stromal layers ('stroma-contact' cultures). This suggests that diffusible stroma-derived factors may be sufficient for the in vitro induction of progenitor proliferation and differentiation. To further characterize stroma-derived factors that maintain long-term bone marrow culture initiating cells (LTBMC-IC), we compared the hematopoietic supportive capacity of human marrow stroma with that of the murine marrow stroma-derived fibroblast cell line M2-10B4 as well as two embryonic fibroblast cell lines, the human FHS-173-WE and the murine NIH-3T3 cell lines. We demonstrate that LTBMC-IC, present in human CD34+/HLA-DR-(DR- cells), are maintained equally well and give rise to similar numbers of committed progenitors, that is - colony-forming cells (CFC) - when cultured in contact with human marrow stroma or any cell line feeder (stroma-contact cultures). LTBMC-IC, cultured in marrow stroma or M2-10B4 stroma-noncontact cultures, were maintained significantly better and gave rise to significantly more CFC than when cultured in human marrow stroma or M2-10B4 contact cultures. However, LTBMC-IC maintenance and differentiation in FHS-173-WE or NIH-3T3 noncontact cultures was significantly less than in human marrow stroma or M2-10B4 noncontact cultures. These studies indicate that systematic comparison of diffusible growth stimulatory factors in conditioned media from M2-10B4 cells and FHS-173-WE may lead to the characterization of growth regulatory factors required for in vitro maintenance and differentiation of human primitive LTBMC-IC. Since diffusible factors from the M2-10B4 cell line can support human hematopoiesis, our observations may also have important implications for in vitro stem cell expansion protocols.},

@article{Sutherland1991,
	Abstract = {Various growth factors are known to stimulate both early and late stages of human hematopoietic cell development in semisolid assay systems, but their role as microenvironmental regulators is poorly understood. To address this problem, we developed a novel coculture system in which highly purified primitive human hematopoietic cells were seeded onto an irradiated feeder layer of cells from a murine marrow-derived stromal cell line (M2-10B4) previously engineered by retroviral-mediated gene transfer to produce specific human factors. Effects on cells at very early, intermediate, and late stages of hematopoiesis were then evaluated by assessing the number of clonogenic cell precursors (long-term culture initiating cells [LTC-IC]), clonogenic cells, and mature granulocyte and macrophage progeny present in the cultures after 5 weeks. In the absence of any feeders, cells at all stages of hematopoiesis decreased to very low levels. In contrast, maintenance of LTC-IC was found to be supported by control murine stromal cells as effectively as by standard human marrow adherent layers. The presence of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interleukin-3-producing M2-10B4 cells in combination was able to further enhance the maintenance and early differentiation of these cells without a decline in their proliferative potential as measured by the clonogenic output per LTC-IC. However, this effect was lost if granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF)-producing feeders were also present. On the other hand, in the presence of GM-CSF-producing feeders, the output of mature granulocytes and macrophages increased 20-fold. These findings show that it is possible to selectively improve the maintenance of very primitive human hematopoietic cells in vitro or their output of mature progeny by appropriate manipulation of the long-term marrow culture system. Further exploitation of this approach should facilitate investigation of the mechanisms operative within the human marrow microenvironment in vivo and the design of protocols for in vitro manipulation of human marrow for future therapeutic applications.},

Later, ascorbic acid, vitamin D 3 , vitamin K 3 and TGF b 1 were used in varying concentrations as supplements to gener-ate a mature osteoblast phenotype. We tested the effects of several combinations of cell culture media, seeding protocols and osteogenic supplements on osteogenic differentiation of human primary osteoblasts. Osteogenic differentiation was analyzed by staining alkaline phosphatase (ALP) with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) and by von Kossa staining of deposited calcium phosphate. The combinations of culture media and sup-plements signifi cantly infl uenced osteogenic differentiation, but the seeding protocol did not. Staining of ALP and calcium phosphate could be achieved only if our own mix of osteogenic sup-plements was used in combination with Dulbecco ' s modifi ed Eagle medium or if a commercial mix of osteogenic supplements was used in combination with osteoblast growth medium. Espe-cially for von Kossa, we observed great variations in the staining intensity. Because osteogenic differentiation is a complex process, the origin of the osteoblasts, cell culture media and osteogenic supplements should be established by preliminary experiments to achieve optimal differentiation. Staining of ALP or deposited calcium phosphate should be supplemented with qRT-PCR studies to learn more about the infl uence of specifi c supplements on osteogenic markers.},

Upregulation in gene expression was measured in magnetic particle-labeled HBMSCs in response to TREK-1 activation over a short period (7 days) with an increase in mRNA levels of Sox9, core binding factor alpha1 (Cbfa1), and osteopontin. Magnetic particle-labeled HBMSCs encapsulated into alginate chitosan capsules were exposed to magnetic forces both in vitro and in vivo intermittently for 21 days. After 21 days the encapsulated, magnetic particle-labeled HBMSCs in vivo were viable as evidenced by extensive cell tracker green fluorescence. The mechanical stimulation of HBMSCs labeled with TREK-1 magnetic nanoparticle receptors enhanced expression of type-1 collagen in vitro with increases in proteoglycan matrix, core binding factor alpha1 (Cbfa1) and collagen synthesis, and extracellular matrix production and elevated the expression of type-1 and type-2 collagen in vivo. Additionally, the magnetically remote stimulation of HBMSCs labeled with magnetic nanoparticle arginine{\&}{\#}x2013;glycine{\&}{\#}x2013;aspartic acid considerably enhanced proteoglycan and collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix production and elevated the expression of type-1 and type-2 collagen in vivo and in vitro. Osteogenic mechanosensitive receptor manipulation by magnetic nanotechnology can induce the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cell populations toward an osteogenic lineage. These cell manipulation strategies offer tremendous therapeutic opportunities in soft and hard tissue repair.},

	Abstract = {Stromal cells from marrow hold a great promise for bone regeneration. Even if they are already being exploited in many clinical settings, the biological basis for the source and maintenance of their proliferation/differentiation potential after in vitro isolation and expansion needs further investigation. Most studies on osteogenic differentiation of marrow stromal cells (MSC) have been performed using bone marrow from the iliac crest. In this study, MSC were derived from spare femoral bone marrow obtained during hip replacement surgery from 20 adult donors. After in vitro isolation the cells were grown in osteogenic medium, and their proliferation and differentiation analysed during in vitro expansion. We found that MSC isolated from the femur of adult patients consistently maintain an osteogenic potential. Using biochemical signals, these cells turn to fully differentiated osteoblasts with a predictable set of molecular and phenotypic events of in vitro bone deposition. When seeded on polycaprolactone-based scaffold or surfaces, the proliferation and mineralization of femur-derived MSC were modulated by the surface chemistry/topography. Despite remarkable differences between individual colony-forming ability, alkaline phosphatase production, and mineralization ability, these cells are a potential source for bone engineering, either by direct autologous reimplantation or by ex vivo expansion and reimplantation combined to a proper scaffold. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {The development of a new family of implantable bioinspired materials is a focal point of bone tissue engineering. Implant surfaces that better mimic the natural bone extracellular matrix, a naturally nano-composite tissue, can stimulate stem cell differentiation towards osteogenic lineages in the absence of specific chemical treatments. Herein we describe a bioactive composite nanofibrous scaffold, composed of poly-caprolactone (PCL) and nano-sized hydroxyapatite (HA) or beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP), which was able to support the growth of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and guide their osteogenic differentiation at the same time. Morphological and physical/chemical investigations were carried out by scanning, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, mechanical and wettability analysis. Upon culturing hMSCs on composite nanofibers, we found that the incorporation of either HA or TCP into the PCL nanofibers did not affect cell viability, meanwhile the presence of the mineral phase increases the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an early marker of bone formation, and mRNA expression levels of osteoblast-related genes, such as the Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx-2) and bone sialoprotein (BSP), in total absence of osteogenic supplements. These results suggest that both the nanofibrous structure and the chemical composition of the scaffolds play a role in regulating the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs.},

Gordon were used to separate and blot the antigens onto nitrocellulose. The remaining sites of attachment were blocked and the nitrocellulose was washed with polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20). The blot was then reacted with the antiserum or hybridoma supernate to be tested. After the antigen-antibody reaction was completed, the blot was washed and treated with anti-antibody which has been conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The alkaline phosphatase was detected by the reduction of the tetrazolium salt to diformazan by the hydrogen ions released in the formation of indigo by the reaction of the phosphatase on the indoxyl phosphate. The advantages of this method over previously described techniques are (1) use of Tween 20 allows the blot to be stained with Coomassie blue, (2) the substrates of the alkaline phosphatase reaction are stable for long periods of time, (3) the reaction products form an intense blue color which does not fade, (4) the resolution is extremely good with little to no band broadening, (5) the reaction is sensitive to picogram quantities of antigen, and (6) the reaction is quantitative. ?? 1984.},

	Abstract = {Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is the most widely recognized biochemical marker for osteoblast activity. Although its precise function is poorly understood, it is believed to play a role in skeletal mineralization. The aim of this study was to develop an assay suitable for measuring the activity of this enzyme in microtiter plate format. Using the well-characterized osteoblast-like cell line Saos-2, this paper describes an optimized biochemical assay suitable for measuring ALP activity in tissue culture samples. We have determined that a p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate concentration of 9 mM provides highest enzyme activities. We have found that cell concentration, and hence enzyme concentration, affects both the kinetics and precision of the assay. We also tested several methods of enzyme solubilization and found that freeze-thawing the membrane fractions twice at -70 degrees C/37 degrees C or freeze-thawing once with sonication yielded highest enzyme activities. The activity of the enzyme decreased by 10{\%} after 7 days storage. This assay provides a sensitive and reproducible method that is ideally suited for measuring ALP activity in isolated osteoblastic cells, although sample preparation and storage can influence results.},
