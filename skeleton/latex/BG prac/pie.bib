	Abstract = {Despite its apparent simplicity, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has developed into an important model for biomedical research, particularly in the functional characterization of novel drug targets that have been identified using genomics technologies. The cellular complexity and the conservation of disease pathways between C. elegans and higher organisms, together with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of cultivation, make for an effective in vivo model that is amenable to whole-organism high-throughput compound screens and large-scale target validation. This review describes how C. elegans models can be used to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drug action and disease pathogenesis.},

	Abstract = {In the 4-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, two blastomeres are destined to generate pharyngeal cells, each by a distinct developmental strategy: one pathway is inductive, while the other is autonomous. Here, we identify the pha-4 locus. In animals lacking pha-4 activity, an early step in pharyngeal organogenesis is blocked: no pharyngeal primordium is formed and differentiated pharyngeal cells are absent. Most other tissues are generated normally in pha-4 mutants, including cells related to pharyngeal cells by cell lineage and position. Thus, pha-4 activity is required to form the pharyngeal primordium. We propose that pha-4 marks a convergence of the inductive and autonomous pathways of pharyngeal development and suggest that establishment of pharyngeal organ identity is a crucial step for pharyngeal organogenesis.},

@article{Sarafi-Reinach2000,
	Abstract = {Caenorhabditis elegans responds to its complex chemical environment using a small number of chemosensory neurons. Each of these neurons exhibits a unique sensory response repertoire. The developmental mechanisms that generate this diversity of function are largely unknown. Many C. elegans chemosensory neurons, including the AWA and ASG neurons, arise as lineal sisters of an asymmetric division. Here we describe the gene unc-130, which plays a role in the generation of the AWA and ASG neurons. In unc-130 mutants, the ASG neurons adopt the fate of the AWA neurons. unc-130 encodes a member of the forkhead domain family of transcription factors, and is expressed in the precursors to AWA and ASG neurons. Misexpression of unc-130 in the AWA neurons is partly sufficient to repress the AWA fate, but not to promote ASG fate. unc-130 also plays a role in the development of additional chemosensory neurons. Our experiments show that the ASG neurons share a developmental default state in common with three types of olfactory neurons. We propose that distinct cell fates and hence diversity of function in the chemosensory neurons of C. elegans are generated in a hierarchical manner, utilizing both lineage-dependent and independent mechanisms.},

@article{Nash2000,
	Abstract = {Secreted proteins required for cellular movements along the circumference of the body wall in Caenorhabditis elegans include UNC-6/netrin and the novel TGF-beta UNC-129. Expression of these proteins is graded along the dorsoventral (D/V) axis, providing polarity information to guide migrations. Here we show that the graded expression of UNC-129 in dorsal but not ventral body muscles depends on unc-130, which encodes a Forkhead transcription factor. The phenotype of unc-130 mutants closely mimics the reported effects of ectopically expressing unc-129 in both dorsal and ventral body muscles (). This fits our present finding that unc-130 cell autonomously represses unc-129 expression in the ventral body muscles. Thus the cell-specific effects of unc-130 on ventral, but not dorsal, body muscle expression of unc-129 accounts for the D/V polarity information required for UNC-129-mediated guidance. Genetic interactions between unc-130 and other guidance genes show that several molecular pathways function in parallel to guide the ventral to dorsal migration of distal tip cells (DTCs) and axonal growth cones in C. elegans. Genetic interactions confirm that UNC-129 does not require the only known type II TGF-beta receptor in C. elegans (DAF-4) for its guidance functions. Also, unc-130 is partially required for male tail morphogenesis and for embryogenesis.},

@article{Kersey2016,
	Abstract = {Spatial polarity cues in animals are used repeatedly during development for many processes, including cell fate determination, cell migration, and axon guidance. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the body wall muscle extends the length of the animal in four distinct quadrants and generates an UNC-129/TGF-$\beta$-related signal that is much higher in the dorsal two muscle quadrants compared to their ventral counterparts. This pattern of unc-129 expression requires the activity of the proposed transcriptional repressor UNC-130/FOXD whose body wall muscle activity is restricted to the ventral two body wall muscle quadrants. To understand how these dorsal-ventral differences in UNC-130 activity are established and maintained, we have analyzed the regulation of unc-130 expression and the distribution of UNC-130 protein. We have identified widespread, cis-acting elements in the unc-130 promoter that function to positively regulate ventral body wall muscle expression and negatively regulate dorsal body wall muscle expression. We have defined the temporal distribution of UNC-130 protein in body wall muscle cells during embryogenesis, demonstrated that this pattern is required to establish the dorsal-ventral polarity of UNC-129/TGF-$\beta$, and shown that UNC-130 is not required post-embryonically to maintain the asymmetry of body wall muscle unc-129 expression. Finally, we have tested the impact of the depletion of a variety of transcription factors, repressors, and signaling molecules to identify additional regulators of body wall muscle UNC-130 polarity. Our results confirm and extend earlier studies to clarify the mechanisms by which UNC-130 is controlled and affects the pattern of unc-129 expression in body wall muscle. These results further our understanding of the transcriptional logic behind the generation of polarity cues involving this poorly understood subclass of Forkhead factors.},

@article{Liu2009,
	Abstract = {Both in vivo and in vitro studies indicate a correlation between reduced acetylation of histone core proteins and oligodendrocyte development. The nature of these histone modifications and the mechanisms mediating them remain undefined. To address these issues, we utilized OL-1 cells, a rat nontransformed oligodendrocyte cell line, and primary oligodendrocyte cultures. We found that the acetylated histone H3 at lysine 9 and lysine 14 (H3K9/K14ac) is reduced in both the myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP) genes of maturing oligodendroglial OL-1 cells, and furthermore, this temporally correlates with increases in MBP, PLP, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) 11 expression. Disruption of developmentally-regulated histone H3 deacetylation within the MBP and PLP genes by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A blunts MBP and PLP expression. With its increased expression, interaction of HDAC 11 with acetylated histone H3 and recruitment of HDAC 11 to the MBP and PLP genes markedly increases in maturing OL-1 cells. Moreover, suppressing HDAC 11 expression with small interfering RNA significantly (1) increases H3K9/K14ac globally and within the MBP and PLP genes, (2) decreases MBP and PLP mRNA expression, and (3) blunts the morphological changes associated with oligodendrocyte development. Our data strongly support a specific role for HDAC 11 in histone deacetylation and in turn the regulation of oligodendrocyte-specific protein gene expression and oligodendrocyte development.},

@article{Gregoretti,
	Abstract = {Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modify core histones and participate in large regulatory complexes that both suppress and enhance transcription. Recent studies indicate that some HDACs can act on non-histone proteins as well. Interest in these enzymes is growing because HDAC inhibitors appear to be promising therapeutic agents against cancer and a variety of other diseases. Thus far, 11 members of the HDAC family have been identified in humans, but few have been characterized in detail. To better define the biological function of these proteins, make maximal use of studies performed in other systems, and assist in drug development efforts, we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of all HDAC-related proteins in all fully sequenced free-living organisms. Previous analyses have divided non-sirtuin HDACs into two groups, classes 1 and 2. We find that HDACs can be divided into three equally distinct groups: class 1, class 2, and a third class consisting of proteins related to the recently identified human HDAC11 gene. We term this novel group "class 4" to distinguish it from the unrelated "class 3" sirtuin deacetylases. Analysis of gene duplication events indicates that the common ancestor of metazoan organisms contained two class 1, two class 2, and a single class 4 HDAC. Examination of HDAC characteristics in light of these evolutionary relationships leads to functional predictions, among them that self-association is common among HDAC proteins. All three HDAC classes (including class 4) exist in eubacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial HDAC relatives suggests that all three HDAC classes precede the evolution of histone proteins and raises the possibility that the primary activity of some "histone deacetylase" enzymes is directed against non-histone substrates. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Gene duplication results in two identical paralogs thatdiverge through mutation, leading to loss or gain of interactions with other biomolecules. Here, we comprehensively characterize such network rewiring for C.elegans transcription factors (TFs) within and across four newly delineated molecular networks. Remarkably, we find that even highly similar TFs often have different interaction degrees and partners. In addition, we find that most TF families have a member that is highly connected in multiple networks. Further, different TF families have opposing correlations between network connectivity and phylogenetic age, suggesting that they are subject to different evolutionary pressures. Finally, TFs that have similar partners in one network generally do not in another, indicating a lack of pressure to retain cross-network similarity. Our multiparameter analyses provide unique insights into the evolutionary dynamics that shaped TF networks. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Pagano2007,
	Abstract = {Embryonic development requires maternal proteins and RNA. In Caenorhabditis elegans, a gradient of CCCH tandem zinc finger (TZF) proteins coordinates axis polarization and germline differentiation. These proteins govern expression from maternal mRNAs by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that the TZF protein MEX-5, a primary anterior determinant, is an RNA-binding protein that recognizes linear RNA sequences with high affinity but low specificity. The minimal binding site is a tract of six or more uridines within a 9-13-nucleotide window. This sequence is remarkably abundant in the 3'-untranslated region of C. elegans transcripts, demonstrating that MEX-5 alone cannot specify mRNA target selection. In contrast, human TZF homologs tristetraprolin and ERF-2 bind with high specificity to UUAUUUAUU elements. We show that mutation of a single amino acid in each MEX-5 zinc finger confers tristetraprolin-like specificity to this protein. We propose that divergence of this discriminator residue modulates the RNA-binding specificity in this protein class. This residue is variable in nematode TZF proteins, but is invariant in other metazoans. Therefore, the divergence of TZF proteins and their critical role in early development is likely a nematode-specific adaptation.},

@article{Oldenbroek2012,
	Abstract = {In C. elegans embryos, transcriptional repression in germline blastomeres requires PIE-1 protein. Germline blastomere-specific localization of PIE-1 depends, in part, upon regulated degradation of PIE-1 in somatic cells. We and others have shown that the temporal and spatial regulation of PIE-1 degradation is controlled by translation of the substrate-binding subunit, ZIF-1, of an E3 ligase. We now show that ZIF-1 expression in embryos is regulated by five maternally-supplied RNA-binding proteins. POS-1, MEX-3, and SPN-4 function as repressors of ZIF-1 expression, whereas MEX-5 and MEX-6 antagonize this repression. All five proteins bind directly to the zif-1 3' UTR in vitro. We show that, in vivo, POS-1 and MEX-5/6 have antagonistic roles in ZIF-1 expression. In vitro, they bind to a common region of the zif-1 3' UTR, with MEX-5 binding impeding that by POS-1. The region of the zif-1 3' UTR bound by MEX-5/6 also partially overlaps with that bound by MEX-3, consistent with their antagonistic functions on ZIF-1 expression in vivo. Whereas both MEX-3 and SPN-4 repress ZIF-1 expression, neither protein alone appears to be sufficient, suggesting that they function together in ZIF-1 repression. We propose that MEX-3 and SPN-4 repress ZIF-1 expression exclusively in 1- and 2-cell embryos, the only period during embryogenesis when these two proteins co-localize. As the embryo divides, ZIF-1 continues to be repressed in germline blastomeres by POS-1, a germline blastomere-specific protein. MEX-5/6 antagonize repression by POS-1 and MEX-3, enabling ZIF-1 expression in somatic blastomeres. We propose that ZIF-1 expression results from a net summation of complex positive and negative translational regulation by 3' UTR-binding proteins, with expression in a specific blastomere dependent upon the precise combination of these proteins in that cell. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Renewal of totipotent stem cells in the germline and cellular differentiation during early embryogenesis rely upon posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms. The Caenorhabditis elegans RNA binding protein, MEX-3, plays a key role in both processes. MEX-3 is a maternally-supplied factor that controls the RNA metabolism of transcripts encoding critical cell fate determinants. However, the nucleotide sequence specificity and requirements of MEX-3 mRNA recognition remain unclear. Only a few candidate regulatory targets have been identified, and the full extent of the network of MEX-3 targets is not known. Here, we define the consensus sequence required for MEX-3 RNA recognition and demonstrate that this element is required for MEX-3 dependent regulation of gene expression in live worms. Based on this work, we identify several candidate MEX-3 targets that help explain its dual role in regulating germline stem cell totipotency and embryonic cell fate specification.},

We show here that maternal-effect lethal mutations in the gene mex-3 cause descendants of the anterior blastomere to produce muscles by a pattern of development similar to that of a descendant of the wild-type posterior blastomere. mex-3 encodes a probable RNA-binding protein that is distributed unequally in early embryos and that is a component of germline-specific granules called P granules. We propose that MEX-3 contributes to anterior- posterior asymmetry by regulating one or more mRNAs involved in specifying the fate of the posterior blastomere.},

	Abstract = {In Caenorhabditis elegans, CCCH-type zinc-finger proteins have been shown to be involved in the differentiation of germ cells during embryonic development. Previously, we and others have identified novel redundant CCCH-type zinc-finger proteins, OMA-1 and OMA-2, that are involved in oocyte maturation. In this study, we report that the cytoplasmic expression level of OMA-1 protein was largely reduced after fertilization. In contrast to its cytoplasmic degradation, OMA-1 was found to accumulate exclusively on P granules in germline blastomeres during embryogenesis. A notable finding is that embryos with partially suppressed oma-1; oma-2 expression showed inappropriate germline specification, including abnormal distributions of PGL-1, MEX-1 and PIE-1 proteins. Thus, our results suggest that oma gene products are novel multifunctional proteins that participate in crucial processes for germline specification during embryonic development.},

@article{Guven-Ozkan2010,
	Abstract = {Specification of primordial germ cells requires global repression of transcription. In C. elegans, primordial germ cells are generated through four rounds of asymmetric divisions, starting from the zygote P0, each producing a transcriptionally repressed germline blastomere (P1-P4). Repression in P2-P4 requires PIE-1, which is provided maternally in oocytes and segregated to all germline blastomeres. We have shown previously that OMA-1 and OMA-2 repress global transcription in P0 and P1 by sequestering TAF-4, an essential component of TFIID. Soon after the first mitotic cycle, OMA proteins undergo developmentally regulated degradation. Here, we show that OMA proteins also repress transcription in P2-P4 indirectly, through a completely different mechanism that operates in oocytes. OMA proteins bind to both the 3' UTR of the zif-1 transcript and the eIF4E-binding protein, SPN-2, repressing translation of zif-1 mRNA in oocytes. zif-1 encodes the substrate-binding subunit of the E3 ligase for PIE-1 degradation. Inhibition of zif-1 translation in oocytes ensures high PIE-1 levels in oocytes and germline blastomeres. The two OMA protein functions are strictly regulated in both space and time by MBK-2, a kinase activated following fertilization. Phosphorylation by MBK-2 facilitates the binding of OMA proteins to TAF-4 and simultaneously inactivates their function in repressing zif-1 translation. Phosphorylation of OMA proteins displaces SPN-2 from the zif-1 3' UTR, releasing translational repression. We propose that MBK-2 phosphorylation serves as a developmental switch, converting OMA proteins from specific translational repressors in oocytes to global transcriptional repressors in embryos, together effectively repressing transcription in all germline blastomeres.},

	Abstract = {In C. elegans, four asymmetric divisions, beginning with the zygote (P0), generate transcriptionally repressed germline blastomeres (P1-P4) and somatic sisters that become transcriptionally active. The protein PIE-1 represses transcription in the later germline blastomeres but not in the earlier germline blastomeres P0 and P1. We show here that OMA-1 and OMA-2, previously shown to regulate oocyte maturation, repress transcription in P0 and P1 by binding to and sequestering in the cytoplasm TAF-4, a component critical for assembly of TFIID and the pol II preinitiation complex. OMA-1/2 binding to TAF-4 is developmentally regulated, requiring phosphorylation by the DYRK kinase MBK-2, which is activated at meiosis II after fertilization. OMA-1/2 are normally degraded after the first mitosis, but ectopic expression of wild-type OMA-1 is sufficient to repress transcription in both somatic and later germline blastomeres. We propose that phosphorylation by MBK-2 serves as a developmental switch, converting OMA-1/2 from oocyte to embryo regulators. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We present here a genetic characterization of oocyte maturation, using C. elegans as a model system. We show that two TIS11 zinc finger-containing proteins, OMA-1 and OMA-2, express specifically in maturing oocytes and function redundantly in oocyte maturation. Oocytes in oma-1;oma-2 mutants initiate but do not complete maturation and arrest at a defined point in prophase I. Two maturation signal-induced molecular events, including the maintenance of activated MAP kinase, do not occur in Oma oocytes. The Oma prophase arrest is released by inactivation of a MYT-1-like kinase, suggesting that OMA-1 and OMA-2 function upstream of MYT-1 as positive regulators of prophase progression during meiotic maturation.},

Here we demonstrate that, at the molecular level, embryonic development in five Caenorhabditis species proceeds through two distinct milestones in which the transcriptome is resistant to differences in species-specific developmental timings. By comparing the complete protein-coding transcriptomes of individually timed embryos across ten morphological markers, we found that developmental milestones can be characterized by their expression dynamics and activation of key developmental regulators. This approach led us to discover the nematode phylotypic stage and to show that in chordates and arthropods it is represented as two distinct stages, suggesting that animal body plans might evolve by uncoupling and elaboration on formerly synchronous processes.},

@article{Tenenhaus2001,
	Abstract = {The CCCH zinc finger protein PIE-1 is an essential regulator of germ cell fate that segregates with the germ lineage during the first cleavages of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. We have shown previously that one function of PIE-1 is to inhibit mRNA transcription. Here we show that PIE-1 has a second function in germ cells; it is required for efficient expression of the maternally encoded Nanos homolog NOS-2. This second function is genetically separable from PIE-1's inhibitory effect on transcription. A mutation in PIE-1's second CCCH finger reduces NOS-2 expression without affecting transcriptional repression and causes primordial germ cells to stray away from the somatic gonad, occasionally exiting the embryo entirely. Our results indicate that PIE-1 promotes germ cell fate by two independent mechanisms as follows: (1) inhibition of transcription, which blocks zygotic programs that drive somatic development, and (2) activation of protein expression from nos-2 and possibly other maternal RNAs, which promotes primordial germ cell development.},

@article{Ghosh2008,
	Abstract = {In Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, specification of the germ lineage depends on PIE-1, a maternal protein that blocks mRNA transcription in germline blastomeres. Studies in mammalian cell culture have suggested that PIE-1 inhibits P-TEFb, a kinase that phosphorylates serine 2 in the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) repeats of RNA polymerase II during transcriptional elongation. We have tested this hypothesis using an in vivo complementation assay for PIE-1 function. Our results support the view that PIE-1 inhibits P-TEFb using the CTD-like motif YAPMAPT. This activity is required to block serine 2 phosphorylation in germline blastomeres, but unexpectedly is not essential for transcriptional repression or specification of the germline. We find that sequences outside of the YAPMAPT are required to inhibit serine 5 phosphorylation, and that this second inhibitory mechanism is essential for transcriptional repression and specification of the germ lineage. Our results suggest that PIE-1 uses partially redundant mechanisms to block transcription by targeting both the initiation and elongation phases of the transcription cycle.},
