@book{Michener2007,
	Abstract = {The Bees of the World is the definitive reference work on the apiformes. Written by Charles D. Michener, the world's leading authority on bee systematics, The Bees of the World is the only comprehensive, worldwide treatment of all groups of bees -- 1,200 genera and subgenera, including more than 16,000 species. In extensive introductory sections, Michener examines the evolution of bees from wasps, the relations of the families of bees to one another, the evolution of bees in relation to that of flowering plants, the nesting behavior of solitary and social bees, and the structure of immature and adult bees. Drawing on these considerations as well as the fossil record, he speculates on the attributes of the protobee, the common ancestor of all bees. He also cites the major literature on bee biology and describes the need for further research on the systematics and natural history of bees, including their importance as pollinators of crops and natural vegetation. The greater part of the work consists of an unprecedented treatment of bee systematics, with keys (many of them regional) for identification to the subgenus level. For each genus or subgenus, Michener includes a brief natural history describing geographical range, number of species, and noteworthy information pertaining to nesting or floral biology. The work is beautifully illustrated with 48 color photos of bees, and more than 500 black and white drawings and photographs that depict behavior, detailed morphology, and ecology."At least since the time of Aristotle people have been interested in bees because they are fascinating creatures. We are social animals; some bees are also social. Their interactions andcommunications, which make their colonial life function, have long been matters of interest; we wonder how a tiny brain can react appropriately to societal problems similar to those also faced by other social animals, such as humans." -- from The Bees of the World},

	Abstract = {The understanding of bee communities and their association with particular habitats can prove to be a very useful tool in identifying the vulnerability of these organisms to landscape changes and is also fundamental to assess the potential of bees for sustainable use in agriculture. Data on bee communities have been collected in Brazil for more than thirty years and are mainly bee species lists, information on bee abundance, seasonal and daily activity, and lists of mellitophilous plants. A local picture of community composition and structure can be drawn although proper species identification impedes a detailed analysis and limits comparisons among areas. Our intention here is to present overviews of the information on native bees gathered from surveys on bee communities and discuss the implications of the status of current knowledge to native bees conservation and its potential sustainable use.},

@misc{Poisot2012,
	Abstract = {In a context of global changes, and amidst the perpetual modification of community structure undergone by most natural ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how species interactions vary through space and time. The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of $\beta$-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up $\beta$-diversity of community composition to the $\beta$-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.},
