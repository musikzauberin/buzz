abstract = {Known for centuries, the geographical pattern of increasing biodiversity from the poles to the equator is one of the most pervasive features of life on Earth. A long- standing goal of biogeographers has been to understand the primary factors that generate and maintain high diversity in the tropics. Many ‘historical' and ‘ecolog- ical' hypotheses have been proposed and debated, but there is still little consen- sus. Recent discussions have centred around two main phenomena: phylogenetic niche conservatism and ecological productivity. These two factors play important roles, but accumulating theoretical and empirical studies suggest that the single most important factor is kinetics: the temperature dependence of ecological and evolutionary rates. The relatively high temperatures in the tropics generate and maintain high diversity because ‘the Red Queen runs faster when she is hot'.},
