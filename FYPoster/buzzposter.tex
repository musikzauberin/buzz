     %Brief Introduction explaining broader significance of research problem and the gap in knowledge that is being addressed
     %%% Bee-flower interactions differ drastically between subsequent seasons or even weeks. However, this high interaction turnover has been largely overlooked by previous studies, which assume a static picture of pollination networks. Understanding how and why bee-flower interactions vary over time is crucial in the conservation of bees, and in the continuation of their pollination services. Moreover, climate change can result in fluctuating flowering times, thereafter indirectly sabotaging bee-flower interactions. \\
     Understanding how and why plant-pollinator networks (e.g. bee-flower interactions) vary over time is crucial in the conservation of pollinators, and in the continuation of their pollination services. Moreover, climate change can result in fluctuating flowering times, therefore affecting or driving turnover in plant-pollinator interactions. The structure of bee-flower interaction networks is likely to differ between seasons or even shorter timescales of weeks to months. However, this interaction turnover has been largely ignored by previous research on plant-pollinator networks, which assume a static picture of pollination networks. \\

  \block{\Large \hspace{3pt}Calculating turnover}{ \vspace{-5pt}
    \normalsize
In networks, nodes (species) are linked by edges (bee-flower interactions). Differences between networks are reflected by the Whittaker's dissimilarity index, $\boldsymbol{ \beta_{int}}$, given by:
\vspace{-50pt} \\
	
    \begin{align*}
      \boldsymbol{ \beta_{int}} & = \frac{a + b + c}{(2a + b + c)/2} - 1
    \end{align*}\\

    \vspace{-50pt}
    where:    
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=5pt,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt, leftmargin=*]
     \item $a$ is the number of interactions shared between the two networks.
    \item $b$ and $c$ are the number of unique \\ interactions in the two networks.
    \end{itemize}
 \vspace{10pt}
 For example, when comparing between April and May networks in Figure A:
     \vspace{-5pt}
 	    \begin{align*}
      \boldsymbol{ \beta_{int}} & = \frac{11 + 55 + 79}{(2\times11 + 55 + 79)/2} - 1 \\
& = 0.859
    \end{align*} 
    \vspace{-24pt} \\
 $\boldsymbol{ \beta_{int}}$ ranges from 0 to 1. \\
 A higher $\boldsymbol{ \beta_{int}}$ reflects a higher \\difference between monthly networks.

    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=5pt,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt, leftmargin=*]
    \item Bee-flower interaction turnover is higher than ever reported before (CaraDonna, Petry, Brennan, et al., 2017).
    \item There are no significant differences between turnover within seasons and between seasons.
    \item Periodic pattern in turnover of bee-flower interactions is not primarily driven by species turnover.
    \item Currently determining if precipitation and temperature are strong drivers of bee-flower \\ interaction turnover.

    \item Insufficient data.\\ However, $\boldsymbol{\beta_{int}}$ is rarely affected by small sample sizes.
    \item If climate does not affect bee-flower interaction turnover, other factors to be considered include body size and lifespan of bees.
